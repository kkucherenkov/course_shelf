## T-2026-07-18-003 — E18-F01-S02 · Mobile Browse tab (Flutter)

- Created: 2026-07-18
- Completed: 2026-07-18
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [E18-F01-S02](../../docs/roadmap/tasks/E18-F01-S02.md) · design `docs/design/cs-mobile-browse/`
- Result: https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/181 (commit b6e2b33; design `572b0a2`)
- Goal: Browse tab — poster grid (2/3-col), API-backed filter+sort bottom sheet, states.
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] design pre-step: hand-authored `cs-mobile-browse/app.jsx`, verified render (OD MCP down)
  - [x] BrowseCubit + repo (`GET /courses` filter/sort + `GET /libraries`)
  - [x] BrowseTabBody: grid + filter sheet + states; posters → course route
  - [x] i18n + tests · flutter analyze clean · full suite 247/247
- Notes: filters single-select per single-value API; mapping mirrors `apps/web` (omit-when-default).
  Closes #94, #95, #96.

## T-2026-07-18-002 — E18-F01-S03 · Mobile Course detail (spec-first)

- Created: 2026-07-18
- Completed: 2026-07-18
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [E18-F01-S03](../../docs/roadmap/tasks/E18-F01-S03.md) · design `docs/design/cs-mobile-course-detail/`
- Result: https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/181 (spec `7320eb1`, codegen `c7e9344`, backend `f47dc82`, mobile `b6e2b33`)
- Goal: course-detail screen — hero, Resume/Start + Download CTA (size estimate), curriculum.
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] design pre-step (prior session)
  - [x] spec: `GET /courses/{id}/download-estimate` + `CourseDownloadEstimateDto` → validate/bundle/codegen
  - [x] backend: query/handler/controller + spec (4/4)
  - [x] mobile: CourseDetailCubit + pushed-route screen (loading/loaded/noAccess/failed)
  - [~] tap-to-download → **E19 seam** (DownloadsBloc absent; `TODO(E19)`)
- Notes: resolved the spec caveat with a dedicated download-estimate endpoint (not a `CourseDto`
  size field). ⚠️ Download **actions** deferred to E19 — **#101 stays open**. Closes #97, #99, #100.

## T-2026-07-18-001 — E18-F03-S02 · Mobile Search + Settings tabs (Flutter)

- Created: 2026-07-18
- Completed: 2026-07-18
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [E18-F03-S02](../../docs/roadmap/tasks/E18-F03-S02.md) · design `docs/design/cs-mobile-search-settings/`
- Result: https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/181 (commit b6e2b33)
- Goal: Search tab (recent / grouped results / no-match) + Settings (Profile·Appearance·Playback·Account + sign-out).
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] SearchCubit (debounced `/search`) + SettingsCubit (device prefs)
  - [x] Search + Settings screens wired into the 5-tab shell
  - [x] i18n (search + settings namespaces) + widget/bloc tests
  - [x] flutter analyze clean · tests green
- Notes: sign-out flow + language selector preserved; recents + device prefs in-memory
  (`TODO(E18)` to persist — no `shared_preferences` yet). Closes #114, #116, #117.

## T-2026-07-17-008 — design bundles for blocked mobile stories (E18/E19)

- Created: 2026-07-17
- Completed: 2026-07-18
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [DESIGN_BRIEF.md](../../docs/design/DESIGN_BRIEF.md) §7.5 / §7.7 / §7.8
- Goal: unblock E18-F01-S03, E19-F01-S03, E18-F03-S02 by producing the missing
  `cs-mobile-*` mockup bundles via Open Design, matching the landed bundle style.
- Result: bundles landed at `docs/design/{cs-mobile-course-detail,cs-mobile-downloads,cs-mobile-search-settings}/`
  (`app.jsx` + `index.html`) + shared `cs-components` DownloadRow a11y fix
  (`dl-action` → labelled `<button>`). Verified by rendering in Chromium: all
  states present, downloads disclosure keyboard-toggles, DownloadRow controls
  focusable/labelled, lesson-player + cs-components showcase no regression. GitHub:
  design pre-step tasks #98/#128/#115 closed completed; story issues #97/#127/#114
  unblocked (`blocked` label removed + comment). `docs/design/README.md` index
  updated; three cards flipped 🚫 Blocked → ⬜ Not started. **No PR yet** — `docs/`
  is gitignored; land in the next commit with `git add -f`.
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] cs-mobile-course-detail (E18-F01-S03) — OD run b1272736 + audit
  - [x] cs-mobile-downloads (E19-F01-S03) — OD run 3204eaba + a11y audit
  - [x] cs-mobile-search-settings (E18-F03-S02) — OD run d6c9596f + audit
  - [x] shared DownloadRow a11y fix in cs-components + consumer re-verify
  - [x] land bundles + update `docs/design/README.md` index
  - [x] unblock the three cards + reconcile GitHub issues
- Notes: course-detail card retains a spec-gap caveat for implementation
  (`GET /courses/{id}/download-estimate` + a per-course size field on `CourseDto`).

## T-2026-07-17-007 — E18 wave 1: mobile tab shell + the three Stage A cards

- Created: 2026-07-17
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [E18-F01-S01](../../docs/roadmap/tasks/E18-F01-S01.md), [E18-F02-S01](../../docs/roadmap/tasks/E18-F02-S01.md), [E18-F03-S01](../../docs/roadmap/tasks/E18-F03-S01.md)
- Goal: the mobile app becomes navigable — a real 5-tab shell hosting a real Home, with the auth surfaces designed and the lesson player playing video.
- Acceptance:
  - Signing in lands on the 5-tab bottom bar (Home · Browse · Downloads · Search · Settings), not the `Home — replace me` placeholder
  - Home shows Continue-watching + Recently-added carousels and quick links, and pulls to refresh
  - Sign-in / sign-up / forgot render the brand design (AppBrand, PasswordField, SsoBlock, AppBanner) rather than raw Material
  - A lesson plays video in portrait, and rotates to an immersive landscape PlayerChrome
- Spec diff: none — all three cards are `Spec diff: none`; every endpoint already exists
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: `AppNavigationTab` gains an optional `onRefresh` (ui_flutter). No new tokens, no new components — the three mockups consume the existing catalog.
- Tests: bloc_test per Cubit/BLoC; widget tests for the shell; ui_flutter widget tests for the refresh affordance
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] **Shell foundation (serial — blocks Home)**: `onRefresh` on `AppNavigationTab` + adaptive refresh in `AppNavigationShell`; `MainShell` in `apps/mobile`; `AuthGate._HomeScreen` → `MainShell`; pre-wire the `/forgot` + lesson routes so the parallel agents never both edit `routes.dart`
  - [x] **De-template (#156)**: `Appointments` → `CourseShelf`; the appointments nav tabs → the real five; phone-OTP stripped from `AuthState`/`AuthCubit`/`AuthRepository`/`auth_api`; `welcome_screen` + `phone_auth_screen` deleted
  - [x] E18-F01-S01 — `HomeCubit` (Loading | Loaded | Empty | Failed) + Home tab body
  - [x] E18-F03-S01 — rework the placeholder auth screens; add `forgot_screen`; `SignUpCubit` + `ForgotCubit` 3-step machines
  - [x] E18-F02-S01 — `video_player` dependency; player BLoC; portrait tabs + landscape chrome; throttled 10s `progress_outbox` write
- Status: ✅ Done
- Completed: 2026-07-17
- Result: PR https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/174 (merged) — 11 commits, all CI gates green. Closed the three cards' story issues (#91–#93, #102–#106, #107–#113) plus discovery issues #156/#157/#158/#172. Live Widgetbook/visual pass owned by the user (matters more here — the app has never run on a device, #169).
- Blockers: —
- Divergences filed as issues, not silently absorbed:
  - **Password reset can't work against the current backend.** `auth.service.ts` has `emailAndPassword: { enabled, autoSignIn }` but no `sendResetPassword`, so Better Auth returns `RESET_PASSWORD_DISABLED`. The auth screens wire the canonical endpoints and surface the failure (web instead stubs it — `console.warn` + `{ok:true}`). Neither stack can actually reset a password. → new backend issue.
  - **`WatchingOffline` is a flag, not a `PlayerStatus` member** (E18-F02-S01). The card lists it as a state; `DESIGN_BRIEF` §7.6 line 603 defines it as an indicator under the title shown while playing, so as an enum member "paused while offline" is unrepresentable. The BLoC follows the brief over the card.
  - **`AppBrand` (E18-F03-S01) does not exist** in `ui_flutter`, and web has no `@app/ui` twin either (its `AuthBrand` is app-level). Built the mobile twin under `features/auth/presentation/widgets/`, not the catalog.

### What the roadmap got wrong about E18

Verified against the tree before starting:

- **The bottom tab bar was never wired.** `AppNavigationShell` (E17-F02-S07, ✅ Done) had zero consumers outside its own Widgetbook catalog, and `routes.dart` is a flat named-route map with no shell. Every F01/F03 card builds a _tab_ into a host that did not exist. Hence the serial foundation step.
- **Pull-to-refresh was unbuildable.** The shell owns a `CustomScrollView` per tab and wraps each body in a `SliverToBoxAdapter`, so a tab body cannot wrap its own scrollable in a `RefreshIndicator`. E18-F01-S01 requires pull-to-refresh, so the shell has to own it — the catalog component meeting its first real consumer.
- **E18-F03-S01 is a rework, not greenfield.** `sign_in_screen.dart` / `sign_up_screen.dart` already exist from E15-F01-S03 as deliberate placeholders: real `AuthCubit` plumbing and web-mirrored validation behind raw Material widgets. `sign_in_screen.dart` says so itself — _"the final visual design lands in E18-F03-S01"_.
- **The player needs an engine neither stack has.** Web plays video with a raw `<video>` element (`useLessonPlayer.ts`) — no library. Mobile has no playback dependency at all. `video_player` chosen: it wraps ExoPlayer/AVPlayer, the same delegate-to-the-platform stance as `<video>`, so both stacks accept the same formats.

~~Open question, deliberately not answered this wave: **`phone_auth_screen.dart` is on no card.**~~ **Answered 2026-07-17 (owner decision, #156): full de-template, phone auth included.** The phone-OTP path was never Course Shelf's — it is residue from the appointments template the app was scaffolded from, along with `appTitle: "Appointments"` and the Bookings/Chat/SOS/Business tabs. All of it is gone; the backend half (Better Auth `phoneNumber()` plugin + SMS gateway) was removed in parallel.

### What the shell foundation found that no card predicted

- **Sign-in could not reach home — the session cubit was per-screen.** `AuthCubit` is a `registerFactory`, and `AuthGate`, `SignInScreen`, `SignUpScreen` and `SettingsScreen` each did `BlocProvider(create: (_) => getIt<AuthCubit>())`. So a successful sign-in authenticated a cubit _nobody was watching_: the gate held a different instance and never rebuilt. Pushed auth routes could not have shared the gate's provider anyway — they are children of the `MaterialApp`'s `Navigator`, which sits above `home:`. Fixed structurally: `App` provides one `AuthCubit` **above** the `MaterialApp`, and every auth surface reads it. This is why `SettingsScreen`'s sign-out needed `Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(welcome)` — an imperative escape hatch around a state bug. It is gone; the gate reacts on its own.
- **`AuthStatus` had no bootstrapping state.** Initial status was `unauthenticated` (a _resolved_ answer), and `checkSession()` passed through `authenticating` — the same status an interactive submit uses. The gate therefore flashed sign-in for a frame on boot, and would have torn the sign-in form down mid-submit once sign-in became the gate's own child. Added `AuthStatus.unknown` as the initial state; `checkSession()` no longer emits `authenticating`, and the gate keeps the auth screen mounted while a credential submit is in flight so the submit button owns the spinner.
- **`SettingsScreen`'s body was a `ListView`.** Unbounded height inside the shell's `SliverToBoxAdapter` throws. Rebuilt as a `Column`; it also shed its own `Scaffold`/`AppBar`, which the shell supplies.
- **The `/settings` route was dead** — nothing pushed it — and Settings is a tab. Dropped rather than kept as a second, doubled-chrome way in.

Not in this wave, and why: **E18-F01-S02** (Browse) needs a design pre-step — its bundle has `index.html` + `styles.css` but no `app.jsx`, though `cs-mobile-home/app.jsx` does carry a BROWSE reference screen, so it is closer than the card implies. **E18-F01-S03** (Course detail) and **E18-F03-S02** (Search/Settings) are 🚫 Blocked with no bundle at all; F01-S03 additionally needs `GET /courses/{id}/download-estimate` **and** a per-course size field on `CourseDto` that does not exist.

## T-2026-07-17-006 — drop the Forgejo residue and point the release lane at ghcr

- Created: 2026-07-17
- Completed: 2026-07-17
- Owner: claude
- Result: PR https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/155
- Goal: Forgejo was dropped 2026-07-14 and the git remote went with it earlier the same day; clear what was left inside the repo.
- Outcome:
  - **The part that wasn't dead**: `docker/compose.release.yml` defaulted to `${REGISTRY:-code.homelab.local}`, so an unconfigured `docker compose -f docker/compose.release.yml up` — the self-hoster's entry point — pulled from a host that no longer exists. Now `ghcr.io`.
  - That literal is **coupled** to `release.yml`, which sed-rewrites it when staging the release bundle; changing either side alone makes the sed silently no-op and ships unresolved placeholders. Both moved in one commit and both now carry a `⚠` comment. Verified by rendering the sed the way CI does → `ghcr.io/kkucherenkov/courseshelf-{backend,web}:0.2.0`, no placeholders surviving; the old pattern against the new compose leaves two, confirming the hazard was real.
  - Deleted `.forgejo/workflows/` (5 files, 879 lines), `scripts/seed-forgejo-issues.ts` (555 lines), the `issues:sync|map|lookup` scripts, and the CLAUDE.md block warning not to use them.
  - `README.md` / `README.ru.md` carried a mirror notice claiming development happens on Forgejo and _"issues and pull requests opened here are not monitored"_ — the exact inverse of reality, and the first thing a visitor reads.
- Deliberately kept: dated records (`done.md`, `docs/superpowers/plans|specs/*`, and the ✅ Done cards E14-F01-S03 / E22-F01-S06 / E14-F04-S01 / E15-F01-S02) still reference the homelab, because that is what was true when they shipped. Seven `forgejo` mentions survive in live config as _why-this-exists_ rationale with no pointers to deleted files — filed as #165 rather than rewritten, since the constraint may or may not still apply.
- Tests: `turbo run lint` 7/7; `pnpm format:check` clean; `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` still resolves after the script removal.

## T-2026-07-17-005 — design-token hygiene: dangling refs, magic numbers, and the CI gates that let them rot

- Created: 2026-07-17
- Completed: 2026-07-17
- Owner: claude
- Result: [PR #153](https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/153) — branch `chore/design-token-hygiene`
- Goal: make the design-token discipline real — fix what drifted, and close the CI
  holes that let it drift silently. **195 → 0 stylelint violations.**
- Spec diff: none · Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: new theme-independent `media` token group (15 role-named tokens).
  `tokens.g.dart` byte-identical — mobile gained nothing.
- Tests: `@app/ui` 852 + `vue-tsc` clean (had never run in CI); `ui_flutter` 611;
  `turbo run lint` 7/7; `format:check` clean.
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] `AppScanProgress.spec.ts` spread-after-key — a committed snapshot asserted
        "2 errors" for a fixture with `errors: 5`
  - [x] CI — turbo-ise lint + typecheck, add the stylelint gate
  - [x] dangling refs + magic numbers — `packages/ui` (3 agents) and `apps/web`
  - [x] `media` token group + `app-` class prefix rename (11 files, incl. 2 e2e selectors)
- Root cause: CI named packages by hand for lint/typecheck, skipping `@app/ui`
  entirely; stylelint ran nowhere. Same hole that once hid `@app/ui`'s 852 tests —
  documented in a comment three lines below the one that still had it.
- Bugs found that nobody reported:
  - **Phantom `--space-N == N × 2px` scale** (`AppSwitch`, `AppIcon`). Broken twice
    over: the dangling half rendered as nothing, the _resolving_ half at 2–4× intent
    (`AppIcon` `xs`/`sm` drew at 32/64px, not 12/16px). Invisible to dangling scans,
    to stylelint, and to the unit suite.
  - Two dark-theme contrast bugs where `color: white` sat on a fill that lightens.
- Follow-ups surfaced (not filed):
  - **`quality.yml` + `e2e.yml` do not run on pull requests** (nightly/manual only) —
    vestigial Forgejo scheduling kept after the migration to GitHub, where the
    constraint that justified it (paid, shared self-hosted runner) no longer exists.
    The repo is public, so minutes are free; `quality.yml` takes 3 min. **This is why
    every rendering bug above shipped unnoticed.**
  - **e2e nightly is red on `main`** — `foundations visual regression`, an 18px height
    drift (expected `10936px`, received `10918px`). Caught nightly, attributable to no
    PR, unactioned.
  - Stacking-order inversion: bottom tab bar `z-index: 50` → `--z-sticky` (200) now
    outranks the account menu (`--z-dropdown`, 100). Scale and author disagree.
  - `search.vue` `__item-initials` renders white on both an accent thumb and a light
    `--surface-overlay` thumb — pre-existing, deliberately preserved.
- Method note: two of five agents had their work silently destroyed by a `git stash`
  race — `refs/stash` is shared across worktrees and husky's `lint-staged` stashes
  internally. Both recovered from dangling stash commits. Fan-out agents must never
  `git stash`.

## T-2026-07-17-004 — clear the three E17 follow-ups surfaced during the widget waves

- Created: 2026-07-17
- Completed: 2026-07-17
- Owner: claude
- Result: [PR #152](https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/152) — branch `fix/e17-followups`
- Goal: close out the three defects/gaps the E17 fan-out agents surfaced but were
  out of scope to fix in their own cards.
- Outcome: **two of the three reported items were not bugs.** Verifying each claim
  before fixing it is what surfaced two real defects nobody had reported.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: 5 new filled glyphs in both `@app/ui` and `ui_flutter` — no new tokens
- Tests: `ui_flutter` 611 → **630**; `@app/ui` **868** / 50 files; `apps/mobile` **64**.
  All analyze-clean. No golden moved for either semantics fix; icon goldens moved as
  expected and were inspected by eye.
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] `AppRow` — **not a bug, no code changed.** `Semantics` defaults to
        `container: false` (annotates, does not merge) and real interactive
        descendants keep their own nodes. The report's premise was also false —
        `AppBookmark` does not compose `AppRow`.
  - [x] `AppBookmarkAdd` — visible `×` control added, Escape binding retained.
        Cancel is disabled mid-save: it cannot abort a request the widget has no
        handle on, and firing `onCancel` mid-flight would orphan a bookmark the
        user believes they discarded.
  - [x] 5 filled nav glyphs drawn once, applied byte-identically to both stacks,
        wired to `filledIcon`. Additive — the `fill:` / `kFillableIcons` toggle
        still covers only `play`/`bookmark`.
  - [x] **(found)** `AppIconButton` — `ExcludeSemantics` wrapped the whole
        `TextButton`, discarding tap + focus, across all 11 components that
        compose it. Fixed at the source; this was the true cause of the row
        collapse that the `AppRow` report misattributed.
  - [x] **(found)** `AppButton` — `loading` advertised `isEnabled` + `isFocusable`
        with no tap action (`IgnorePointer` sets `isBlockingUserActions`, which
        strips actions but not the flags). Now reports an honest not-enabled node.
- Lesson worth keeping: `tester.tap` only drives hit-testing and never touches the
  semantics layer. The pre-existing `fires onPressed on tap` test passed against a
  button no screen-reader user could activate — the obvious test was structurally
  blind to the bug. Semantics assertions need `tester.semantics.tap` /
  `performAction`.
- Follow-ups surfaced (not filed):
  - An icon-only `AppButton` (icons but no `label`/`child`) is nameless even when
    enabled — `IconCS` contributes no name. `AppIconButton` is the intended
    icon-only control, so this is an edge case.
  - A `child`-only `AppButton` stays nameless while loading — no string is
    extractable from an arbitrary widget. Not a regression; pinned by a test.
  - Repo-wide `pnpm stylelint:fix` fails with ~195 errors across ~20 files, and
    `eslint --fix` rewrites `AppNavigationShell.vue` / `AppSwitch.vue` — all
    pre-existing tree drift, none of it in files this task touched. Picked up as
    [[T-2026-07-17-005]].

## T-2026-07-17-003 — E17-F02 mobile composites wave 2 — closes epic E17

- Created: 2026-07-17
- Completed: 2026-07-17
- Owner: claude
- Result: [PR #151](https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/151) — branch `feat/e17-f02-wave-2`
- Cards: [E17-F02-S10](../../docs/roadmap/tasks/E17-F02-S10.md), [E17-F02-S11](../../docs/roadmap/tasks/E17-F02-S11.md)
- Goal: close E17-F02 (and epic E17) with the two coverage-gap composites whose
  `@app/ui` twins shipped without a mobile card. Both have web twins, so both
  went straight to code under the standing design gate. Two isolated worktree
  subagents, cherry-picked onto one branch, wired, centrally verified.
- Acceptance:
  - Widgetbook catalogues `AppBookmarkList` (empty / populated / add-row / read-only / adding)
    and `AppSectionHeader` (open / closed / long title / singular count) — 46 components, names unique.
  - Both mirror their `@app/ui` twins' contract in light and dark themes.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: two new `ui_flutter` components — no new tokens
- Tests: `ui_flutter` 568 → **611** (38 widget tests + 4 goldens); `apps/mobile` 63 → **64**;
  both analyze-clean. Goldens visually confirmed to bind fonts from `textTheme`.
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] S10 `AppBookmarkList` — list + inline add row + empty state
  - [x] S11 `AppSectionHeader` — collapsible header (count + duration)
  - [x] wire both into the Widgetbook catalog
  - [x] roadmap/TODO bookkeeping + close issues 82–89
- Follow-ups surfaced (not filed):
  - `AppRow` merges descendant semantics — lacks `explicitChildNodes: true`.
  - None of the 5 nav-tab glyphs have a filled variant (`IconCS.fill` covers only play/bookmark).
  - `AppBookmarkAdd` fires `onCancel` only on the Escape key — no visible cancel
    affordance, so `onAddCancel` is unreachable on touch hardware. Inherited from
    E17-F02-S04; matches the web, which has the same gap.

## T-2026-07-17-002 — E17-F02 mobile composite widgets wave 1, 9 cards / 13 components

- Created: 2026-07-17
- Completed: 2026-07-17
- Owner: claude
- Result: [PR #150](https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/150) — branch `feat/e17-f02-wave-1`
- Spec (design-gated trio): [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-17-e17-f02-trio-mobile-composites-design.md](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-17-e17-f02-trio-mobile-composites-design.md)
- Goal: port the first nine E17-F02 mobile composite widgets to `app_ui` (Flutter), each consuming the E17-F01 primitives and catalogued in Widgetbook. Parallel fan-out: six web-twin cards built straight to code; three design-gated composites (S03/S06/S07 — a mobile interaction layer with no web twin) got an approved design first. Built by isolated worktree subagents, cherry-picked onto one branch, wired, and centrally verified.
- Cards: S01 (CourseCard family ×3), S02 (LessonRow), S03 (PlayerChrome), S04 (Bookmark/BookmarkAdd/NoteEditor), S05 (ProgressBadge), S06 (DownloadRow), S07 (NavigationShell), S08 (PasswordField), S09 (SsoBlock).
- Outcome: 13 components in `packages/ui_flutter` + Widgetbook catalog entries wired into `directories.dart`. `ui_flutter` 334 → 568 tests (widget + golden matrices); `apps/mobile` → 63 tests (adds the F02 wiring assertion, catalog count guard >= 44). `flutter analyze` clean in both.
- Sub-steps: all complete.
- Status: done
- Notes:
  - Follow-ups surfaced during the wave (not yet filed): (1) `AppRow` merges descendant semantics into one node — it lacks `explicitChildNodes: true` — so per-child semantic labels can't be isolated; low-risk a11y fix for whoever next touches `AppRow`. (2) None of the 5 navigation-tab glyphs have a filled variant (`IconCS.fill` only covers play/bookmark), so `AppNavigationShell` falls back to the outline glyph for the active tab — an icon-family expansion.
  - Live Widgetbook pass (`pnpm dev:widgetbook`) not run — needs generated platform runners; the user checks the final result. Goldens are Flutter-vs-Flutter regression baselines, visually reviewed during integration.

## T-2026-07-17-001 — E17-F01 mobile widget catalog wave 2, 3 cards / 5 components

- Created: 2026-07-17
- Completed: 2026-07-17
- Owner: claude
- Result: [PR #149](https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/149) — branch `feat/e17-f01-wave-2`
- Goal: port the final three E17-F01 mobile primitives to `app_ui` (Flutter), completing the feature. Same parallel fan-out as wave 1: three cards built by isolated worktree subagents (each briefed with the E17-F01-S02 button recipe), cherry-picked onto one integration branch, reviewed, and centrally verified.
- Cards: E17-F01-S06 (AppDialog + AppBottomSheet), S08 (AppEmptyState + AppErrorState), S14 (AppRadioGroup).
- Outcome: 5 components in `packages/ui_flutter` + Widgetbook catalog entries wired into `directories.dart`. `ui_flutter` 281 → 334 tests (widget + golden matrices — the 3 new suites plus wave-1); `apps/mobile` 60 → 61 tests (adds the wave-2 wiring assertion); `flutter analyze` clean in both. E17-F01 is now complete (S01–S14).
- Sub-steps: all complete.
- Notes:
  - S08 uses `SemanticsRole.status`/`.alert` (mutually exclusive with `liveRegion` by Flutter's own assertion) for the polite-vs-assertive web `role` parity; S14 renders the group label as a visible legend + `SemanticsRole.radioGroup` and makes the row the sole pointer/semantics owner via `ExcludeSemantics`+`IgnorePointer`.
  - During integration, normalized the S06 overlays golden path (was a nested `test/overlays/goldens/goldens/` because the golden test lived inside `goldens/`) to match every other component.
  - Live Widgetbook pass (`pnpm dev:widgetbook`) not run — needs generated platform runners; the user checks the final result. Goldens are Flutter-vs-Flutter regression baselines, visually reviewed during integration.

## T-2026-07-16-009 — E17-F01 mobile widget catalog wave, 9 cards / 22 components

- Created: 2026-07-16
- Completed: 2026-07-16
- Owner: claude
- Result: [PR #148](https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/148) — branch `feat/e17-f01-wave`
- Goal: port the E17-F01 mobile primitive components to `app_ui` (Flutter), cataloguing each in Widgetbook. Executed as a parallel fan-out: nine cards built by isolated worktree subagents (each briefed with the E17-F01-S02 button recipe), cherry-picked onto one integration branch, reviewed, and centrally verified.
- Cards: E17-F01-S03 (7 form fields), S04 (Card/Row/Tabs/Segmented), S05 (Banner/Toast/Alert), S07 (Progress×2/Spinner/Skeleton), S09 (Avatar + role badges), S10 (Chip), S11 (Badge), S12 (Textarea), S13 (NoPermission).
- Outcome: 22 components in `packages/ui_flutter` + Widgetbook catalog entries wired into `directories.dart`. `ui_flutter` 47 → 281 tests (widget + golden matrices); `apps/mobile` → 60 tests (adds catalog-integrity tests); `flutter analyze` clean in both.
- Sub-steps: all complete.
- Status: done
- Notes: live Widgetbook pass (`pnpm dev:widgetbook`) not run — needs generated platform runners; the user checks the final result. All goldens are Flutter-vs-Flutter regression baselines, visually reviewed during integration.

## T-2026-07-16-008 — AppButton + AppIconButton (card E17-F01-S02)

- Created: 2026-07-16
- Completed: 2026-07-16
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-e17-f01-s02-app-button-design.md](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-e17-f01-s02-app-button-design.md)
- Result: [PR #147](https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/147) — branch `feat/e17-f01-s02-app-button`
- Goal: Flutter twins of the web AppButton + AppIconButton in `app_ui` — 4 variants × 3 sizes × states, token-driven. The shared recipe the E17-F01 component wave reuses; retires the E16 CanaryButton placeholder.
- Acceptance:
  - Widgetbook use case per state matches the bundle
  - Uses `Tokens.*` (no hard-coded values; heights are a locally-owned scale, as the web owns `$btn-h-*`)
- Decisions: Material `ButtonStyleButton` + `WidgetStateProperty`, ink ripple suppressed → flat web look with free focus/keyboard/semantics/disabled; flat token colour swap (`accentActive` on press), not a ripple; labels bind off `Theme.textTheme.labelLarge` (packaged sans), never the bare `AppTextStyles` family.
- Outcome: `resolveAppButtonStyle` + `AppButton` + `AppIconButton` in `app_ui`; mobile Widgetbook catalog (Variants/Sizes/States/With icons) with CanaryButton removed. `ui_flutter` 30 → 47 tests (incl. `button_matrix_{light,dark}` goldens); mobile 58 → 58; `flutter analyze` clean in both.
- Sub-steps: all complete.
- Status: done
- Notes:
  - Font-binding fix caught by the golden — button labels were rendering as Ahem boxes because `AppTextStyles.*` carry the bare family; the theme's `labelLarge` is the only source of the packaged (prefixed) sans family.
  - Live Widgetbook pass (`pnpm dev:widgetbook`) not run here — needs generated platform runners; the user checks the final result.

## T-2026-07-16-007 — IconCS Flutter widget, 66-glyph brand icon family (card E17-F01-S01)

- Created: 2026-07-16
- Completed: 2026-07-16
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-e17-f01-s01-icon-cs-design.md](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-e17-f01-s01-icon-cs-design.md)
- Result: [PR #146](https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/146) — branch `feat/e17-f01-s01-icon-cs`
- Goal: the web `IconCS` component's 66 named glyphs, available in Flutter as a single `IconCS` widget in `app_ui`. First real component of E17 (Mobile widget catalog).
- Acceptance:
  - `IconCS(name: IconName.play, size: 16, fill: true)` renders the same glyph as web
  - 66 named values in the `IconName` enum (incl. `at`, `banner`, `github`)
- Decisions: rendered via **flutter_svg** from the web component's **verbatim** SVG markup (overrides the card's custom-painter suggestion — lowest-risk parity path); `currentColor` via a `srcIn` `ColorFilter` (`color` → `IconTheme` → `colorScheme.onSurface`); `fill` templates `play`/`bookmark` geometry; goldens are per-size grid sheets (`icon_grid_{16,20,24}` + `icon_grid_dark_24`), not 198 per-icon PNGs.
- Outcome: `IconName` enum (66) + `kIconMarkup` + `buildIconSvg` + `IconCS` in `app_ui`; registered in the mobile Widgetbook catalog (gallery / sizes / fill). `ui_flutter` 15 → 30 tests, mobile 57 → 58; `flutter analyze` clean in both. `flutter_svg` added as a regular dep of `app_ui`.
- Sub-steps: all complete.
- Status: done
- Notes:
  - Visual pass in Widgetbook on a device/emulator (`pnpm dev:widgetbook`) not run here — needs generated platform runners (out of scope); the user checks the final result. Goldens are Flutter-vs-Flutter regression baselines.
  - `pdf` glyph's `<text>` renders stably despite flutter_svg's limited `<text>` support — accepted per the design doc.

## T-2026-07-16-006 — bootstrap mobile Widgetbook catalog (card E16-F01-S01)

- Created: 2026-07-16
- Completed: 2026-07-16
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-e16-f01-s01-widgetbook-bootstrap-design.md](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-e16-f01-s01-widgetbook-bootstrap-design.md)
- Result: [PR #145](https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/145) — branch `feat/e16-f01-s01-widgetbook`
- Goal: a separately-runnable Widgetbook entrypoint catalogs mobile widgets, with one canary exercised across its states.
- Acceptance:
  - `flutter run -t widgetbook/main.dart` shows the catalog (verified manually)
  - one canary (`CanaryButton`) has a use case per state (Enabled / Disabled)
- Outcome: added `apps/mobile/widgetbook/main.dart` (thin entrypoint) + `lib/widgetbook/{canary_button,directories,widgetbook_app}.dart`; `widgetbook` promoted to a regular dep (catalog under `lib/`, tree-shaken from the release binary); `pnpm dev:widgetbook` script. Mobile suite 54 → 57; `flutter analyze` clean.
- Sub-steps: all complete.
- Status: done

## T-2026-07-16-005 — email-primary mobile auth + OTP test coverage (card E15-F01-S03)

- Created: 2026-07-16
- Completed: 2026-07-16
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-e15-f01-s03-email-primary-auth-design.md](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-e15-f01-s03-email-primary-auth-design.md)
- Result: PR (pending) — branch `feat/e15-f01-s03-email-primary-auth`
- Goal: close E15-F01-S03. Phone-OTP runtime already shipped; real gaps were (1) zero OTP test coverage and (2) shipped UI led with phone-OTP, contradicting the closeout spec's email-primary decision. Flipped login to email-primary (web-mirror single screen), phone-OTP demoted to a secondary link; added OTP + wire + widget tests; removed vestigial `devCode`; corrected the card.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no (slang i18n regen only; `strings*.g.dart` is gitignored)
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] tests: OTP `blocTest` cases (requestOtp/verifyOtp/resetToPhoneStep, otpSent/error, OtpError mapping) + `auth_api_test` (mocked Dio: send/verify paths, payloads, 400/410→OtpError, token persist) + `sign_in_screen_test` & `sign_up_screen_test` widget tests. Mobile suite 37 → 54.
  - [x] cleanup: removed `devCode` from `AuthState` + `AuthCubit`; corrected the cubit doc comment (email primary)
  - [x] i18n: added `signIn.phoneInstead`/`errorEmailInvalid`/`errorPasswordTooShort` + `signUp.errorNameRequired`/`errorEmailInvalid`/`errorPasswordTooShort`; renamed `welcome.continueWithPhone`→`getStarted` across en/el/ru/uk; regen slang
  - [x] UI: extracted phone/OTP verbatim to `PhoneAuthScreen` (`/sign-in/phone`) + shared `AuthErrorBanner`/`AuthInfoBanner`; rewrote `SignInScreen` as email form; real email `SignUpScreen`; Welcome CTA label → `getStarted`; routes
  - [x] verify: `flutter analyze` clean; `flutter test` 54/54; `pnpm check:i18n` exit 0 (mobile 4×89)
  - [x] corrected card E15-F01-S03 + TODO.md row → done
- Status: done
- Notes:
  - Deferred to E18-F03-S01 (unchanged): final login visual design, `SignInCubit`/first-user routing, rate-limit banner, keep-signed-in, forgot-password. Sign-up server-error mapping is minimal (`errorEmailTaken`) pending that redesign.
  - Ran on the emulator/device: not done here — widget tests drive the screens (render/validate/submit/navigate), but the visual pass is the user's ("I'll check the final result").

## T-2026-07-16-004 — patch CRITICAL websocket-driver advisory (CI security gate)

- Created: 2026-07-16
- Completed: 2026-07-16
- Owner: claude
- Result: PR #143 (merged) — commit 3323a0e
- Goal: CI "Dependency vulnerability scan" failed on `CRITICAL websocket-driver@0.7.4` (GHSA-xv26-6w52-cph6 / CVE-2026-54466 — WebSocket length-header integer-precision parsing flaw, fixed in 0.7.5). Pulled in transitively: `firebase-admin@13.8.0 → @firebase/database → faye-websocket@0.11.4 → websocket-driver`. No direct dep to bump.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] traced the chain with `pnpm why`; confirmed patched version 0.7.5 via the advisory (affected `<0.7.5`; faye-websocket requires `>=0.5.1`, so satisfied)
  - [x] added `pnpm.overrides` entry `"websocket-driver": ">=0.7.5"` (open-ended, matching the `shell-quote`/`next` security-remediation idiom); regenerated lockfile — 0.7.5 only, zero 0.7.4
  - [x] reproduced the exact CI scan locally (`ghcr.io/google/osv-scanner:v2.3.8`, same jq gate): CRITICAL/HIGH list empty → gate passes; histogram LOW:7 MODERATE:34 (was CRITICAL:1 MODERATE:35)
  - [x] `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in sync
  - [x] commit + push

## T-2026-07-16-003 — de-flake timezone-coupled outbox ordering test (E15-F02-S01)

- Created: 2026-07-16
- Completed: 2026-07-16
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [docs/roadmap/tasks/E15-F02-S01.md](../../docs/roadmap/tasks/E15-F02-S01.md)
- Result: PR #143 (merged) — commit 5d1dc14
- Goal: `progress_outbox pending is chronological across mixed local/UTC writes` (added under T-2026-07-16-002 / I1) hard-coded `DateTime(2026,7,15,23)` and a comment asserting "this machine's local zone is UTC+04:00". True on the dev box (+0400), false on CI (`/home/runner`, TZ=UTC), where `earlyLocal` becomes 23:00Z — genuinely _later_ than `laterUtc` 21:00Z — so `pending()` correctly returns `['late','early']` and the assertion fails. A real test defect, not a runtime bug: `_normalizeUtc` is correct and independently proven by the zone-independent `isUtc` test.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] reproduced: `TZ=UTC flutter test …` fails `['late','early']`; ambient `+0400` passes
  - [x] derive the local fixture from a fixed instant (`DateTime.utc(2026,7,15,19).toLocal()`) so "early is earlier" holds in any ambient zone, while still exercising the local-write path (`isUtc == false`)
  - [x] rewrote the comment to explain the zone-independence; kept the reversed insertion order that guards `ORDER BY`
  - [x] `flutter analyze` clean; full file green under TZ=UTC, America/New_York (−5), Asia/Dubai (+4)
  - [x] commit + PR (#143)
- Status: done
- Blockers: —
- Notes:
  - Did NOT run `dart format` on the file — local Dart 3.12 tall-style reflowed every `test(...)` callback, but CI pins Flutter 3.44.4 (Dart 3.9, old style) and runs no `dart format` gate. Kept the edit in the committed style; diff is the one comment block + one line.

## T-2026-07-16-002 — Drift branch review fixes: mutation-proof outbox tests, UTC normalization, docs correction, index (E15-F02-S01)

- Created: 2026-07-16
- Completed: 2026-07-16
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-15-e15-f02-s01-drift-schema-design.md](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-15-e15-f02-s01-drift-schema-design.md)
- Result: (PR pending)
- Goal: fix whole-branch review findings on `feat/e15-f02-s01-drift` before PR opens — every finding was a test that could not fail or documentation that contradicted the code, not a runtime bug.
- Spec diff: none (docs + tests + a non-schema-version-bumping index)
- Codegen impact: no
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] I1: `progress_outbox` "chronological" tests inserted rows already in order, so the default rowid scan passed them for free even with `ORDER BY` deleted. Rewrote both to insert out of order and assert full returned order.
  - [x] I2: `_normalizeUtc` was stripped from `notes_outbox_dao.dart` and `bookmarks_outbox_dao.dart` with no test catching it (their tests only used `DateTime.utc(...)`, so `.toUtc()` was a no-op). Added a local-DateTime normalization test to each group, mirroring the existing `progress_outbox` one.
  - [x] I3: `CachedCatalogDao` never normalized `cachedAt`/`updatedAt` to UTC despite both being documented TTL/staleness-comparison inputs for E18/E19. Added `.toUtc()` normalization at the write boundary (`upsertCourse`, `replaceOutline`) via small private helpers matching the outbox DAO style, plus a round-trip test.
  - [x] I4: `bookmarks_outbox` was documented "APPEND-ONLY... cannot coalesce by key" while the code actually upserts on `localId`, coalescing create+update into a single `update` row with `serverId == null` at ENQUEUE time — not at drain, as the design doc's "E20 performs the collapse" claimed. Corrected `tables/bookmarks_outbox.dart`, `daos/bookmarks_outbox_dao.dart` (documented the real serverId-based drain rule), the design doc's "bookmark id problem" section and its Testing-table mutation row, and `docs/roadmap/tasks/E15-F02-S01.md`'s Notes. Added a test proving the enqueue-time collapse.
  - [x] Added `@TableIndex` on `cached_lessons.courseId` and `cached_sections.courseId` — the "one indexed read rather than a join" comment on `CachedLessons.courseId` was false as shipped (zero indexes existed). No `schemaVersion` bump needed (still v1, pre-ship).
  - [x] M1: renamed `cached_catalog_dao_test.dart`'s `replaceOutline is idempotent — re-running does not duplicate` (it passed even with `replaceOutline` reduced to a pure upsert — the real guard is the later "drops rows the server no longer returns" test) to `re-running replaceOutline with the same outline does not duplicate rows`.
  - [x] M2: added a nonce round-trip test to `downloads_dao_test.dart` — the crypto-relevant `nonce` column was never written in any test, only asserted null.
  - [x] Mutation proofs — deleted `..orderBy(...)` from `progress_outbox_dao.dart` (2 I1 tests failed), stripped `_normalizeUtc` from `notes_outbox_dao.dart` (I2 notes test failed) and `bookmarks_outbox_dao.dart` (I2 bookmarks test failed), stripped `.toUtc()` from `CachedCatalogDao.upsertCourse` (I3 test failed). All four reverted after confirming failure; suite green again after each revert.
  - [x] `flutter analyze` clean; `flutter test` — 37/37 green.
- Status: done
- Notes:
  - Constraints honored: no change to `build.yaml`, `schemaVersion` (still 1), or the crypto boundary; no sync/drain/collapse logic added — only documentation of the drain rule E20 must follow.
  - `git status --short` on `docs/` showed both edited files as tracked (`M`, not untracked), so no `git add -f` was needed despite the global `docs/*` gitignore rule — they predate that rule.

## T-2026-07-16-001 — Drift local persistence: DownloadsDao + DI registration (E15-F02-S01)

- Created: 2026-07-16
- Completed: 2026-07-16
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [E15-F02-S01](../../docs/roadmap/tasks/E15-F02-S01.md)
- Result: (PR pending)
- Goal: close out E15-F02-S01 — local persistence for cache + outbox + downloads in `apps/mobile`. This task was the last of a six-task plan; tasks 1-5 landed the 7 tables and the cache/outbox DAOs (`CachedCatalogDao`, `ProgressOutboxDao`, `NotesOutboxDao`, `BookmarksOutboxDao`). This task adds `DownloadsDao`, registers `AppDatabase` in the get_it composition root, and closes out the card.
- Spec diff: none (no OpenAPI/AsyncAPI change)
- Codegen impact: no
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] failing test first: `apps/mobile/test/shared/db/downloads_dao_test.dart` (4 cases — round-trip defaults, upsert-advances-without-duplicating, byState filtering, remove-deletes)
  - [x] `DownloadsDao` (`apps/mobile/lib/shared/db/daos/downloads_dao.dart`) — `upsert`, `byLessonId`, `byState`, `watch`, `remove`; holds no key material, only the per-file AES-GCM `nonce`
  - [x] registered in `AppDatabase` (`daos:` list) and re-exported via `export ... show DownloadsDao` — a plain `import` doesn't propagate the type generated in a DAO's own `part` file to callers that only import `app_database.dart`
  - [x] `AppDatabase` registered as a `registerLazySingleton<AppDatabase>(AppDatabase.open)` in `shared/di/injector.dart`
  - [x] `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` — clean, no `InvalidOutputException`
  - [x] roadmap bookkeeping: `E15-F02-S01` → Done, `docs/roadmap/TODO.md` row ticked
- Status: done
- Notes:
  - Security-critical: `downloaded_lessons` carries the per-file nonce but NOT the AES key — E19 keeps a device-bound key in `flutter_secure_storage`. The existing `app_database_test.dart` assertion that no column name contains `key` was left untouched and still passes.
  - Deliberately did NOT add `.toUtc()` normalization to `DownloadsDao.upsert`, unlike the outbox DAOs (`ProgressOutboxDao._normalizeUtc`). Those normalize because drift's TEXT datetime encoding makes local/UTC `DateTime`s sort non-chronologically under `ORDER BY`, and the outbox queries order by timestamp. `DownloadsDao` has no such ordering contract in this story — added scope would be silent and unrequested. Flagging for whoever writes the E19 download-progress UI: if a query ever orders by `updatedAt`, revisit.
  - Test-file gotcha not in the original brief: drift's top-level export collides with `flutter_test` on **both** `isNotNull` and `isNull` (the brief's sibling-pattern reference only needed to hide `isNotNull`); `downloads_dao_test.dart` uses both matchers, so the import is `hide isNotNull, isNull`.
  - Whole suite: 27 pre-existing + 4 new = 31 tests, all green. `flutter analyze` clean.
  - PR not yet opened — same holding pattern as T-2026-07-15-001, blocked on a separate decision the user is handling.

## T-2026-07-15-001 — Flutter design-system theme from generated tokens (E15-F01-S01, E15-F01-S02 bookkeeping)

- Created: 2026-07-15
- Completed: 2026-07-15
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [E15-F01-S01](../../docs/roadmap/tasks/E15-F01-S01.md), [E15-F01-S02](../../docs/roadmap/tasks/E15-F01-S02.md)
- Result: (PR pending)
- Goal: `AppTheme` in `packages/ui_flutter` built from the generated design tokens, wired into `apps/mobile`, replacing the placeholder `ColorScheme.fromSeed` seed; close out the long-shipped E15-F01-S02 Dio/bearer wiring as bookkeeping.
- Spec diff: none (no OpenAPI/AsyncAPI change)
- Codegen impact: no
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] `AppTheme.light()` / `AppTheme.dark()` in `packages/ui_flutter/lib/src/theme/app_theme.dart`, built from `tokens.g.dart`
  - [x] brightness-dependent colours/shadows as `AppSemanticColors` / `AppShadows` `ThemeExtension`s; brightness-independent tokens (spacing, radius, durations, easings, opacity) stay plain constants
  - [x] `packages/ui_flutter/lib/app_ui.dart` now exports tokens + theme + the demo screen (previously exported nothing)
  - [x] golden-tested token demo screen at `packages/ui_flutter/lib/src/example/token_demo_screen.dart` (light + dark, 420x1400), mirroring `apps/web/app/pages/dev/foundations.vue`
  - [x] bundle IBM Plex Sans/Mono on both platforms (`packages/ui_flutter/fonts/` + `@fontsource/*` in `apps/web`) — the tokens named the family but nothing loaded it; web rendered `system-ui`
  - [x] `apps/mobile/lib/main.dart` uses `AppTheme.light()`/`.dark()`, replacing the placeholder `ColorScheme.fromSeed(0xFF6750A4)`
  - [x] `.husky/commit-msg` + commitlint `scope-enum` aligned with real usage (commitlint was configured but never invoked)
  - [x] roadmap bookkeeping: E15-F01-S01 → Done, E15-F01-S02 Notes closed out (code shipped earlier; issues never closed because `pnpm issues:sync` targets a Forgejo host dropped 2026-07-14)
- Status: done
- Notes:
  - Card's `ThemeData.fromTokens()` sub-step name predates the scaffolding comment in `main.dart`, which already specified `AppTheme` — shipped as `AppTheme.light()`/`.dark()` instead.
  - Issue numbers: E15-F01-S01 → story #4, tasks #5 #6 #7. E15-F01-S02 → story #8, tasks #9 #10 #11 (shipped long ago; closed via this work's future PR `Closes` keywords, not `pnpm issues:sync`).
  - PR not yet opened — blocked on a separate decision the user is handling. This entry documents the shipped code and bookkeeping; update `- Result:` with the PR link once it lands.

## T-2026-07-14-004 — GitHub Projects board for mobile (E15–E20) + frontend-alignment realignment (#136)

- Created: 2026-07-14
- Completed: 2026-07-14
- Owner: claude
- Spec: user request — populate a GitHub Projects v2 board with epics E15–E20 (stories + tasks), reviewing each card for alignment with the real frontend decisions/pivots; ensure design tokens match the real SCSS (SCSS = source of truth)
- Result: merged via PR #136 (`7950234`). Board live: https://github.com/users/kkucherenkov/projects/1 — 133 issues (6 epics + 40 stories + 87 tasks).
- Goal: an honest GitHub Projects board (Epic→Story→Task sub-issue tree, status seeded from reality) for the mobile epics, with the roadmap source corrected where it drifted from what actually shipped.
- Spec diff: none (no OpenAPI/AsyncAPI change)
- Codegen impact: no
- Decisions (user): Projects v2 board + native sub-issues · full Epic+Story+Task tree · report-first review, amend on approval · fix source + create corrected issues · full status seeding from reality · add all 6 E17 coverage-gap stories · one combined PR
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] scope grant (`gh auth refresh -s project,read:project`) + verify
  - [x] 3-dimension alignment review (stack · component catalog · features/API)
  - [x] fix `.claude/agents/flutter-engineer.md` — it prescribed Riverpod + "no get_it", the opposite of CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md and the shipped `apps/mobile` (flutter_bloc + get_it). Highest-leverage fix: any agent handed a mobile card would have built the wrong stack.
  - [x] tokens ↔ SCSS check — VALUES fully aligned; there is no upstream hand-authored SCSS (packages/ui has 0 `.scss` files), tokens.json IS the source. Found + fixed a real web bug instead: `@theme inline` referenced ~14 names the generator never emits (dangling `var()`s), and Nuxt UI's `primary:'accent'` had no accent scale at all. Added `radius.xs/xl/2xl` + the accent 50–950 amber ramp; repointed stale refs. 0 dangling (was ~14).
  - [x] correct E15–E20 source: live `.md` cards + mirror into `generate.py` (NOT re-run — `render_task()` hardcodes "Not started" and would wipe all 121 card statuses). Dead refs (DESIGN.md/PRD.md don't exist), 61→66 icons, AppDropdown→AppSelect, CourseCard 3 widgets + resumeLabel, Browse filters, 3 Blocked.
  - [x] add 6 E17 coverage-gap stories (AppBadge, AppTextarea, AppNoPermission, AppRadioGroup, AppBookmarkList, AppSectionHeader) — needed `git add -f` (global `~/.gitignore: docs/*`)
  - [x] enable repo issues; create Projects v2 board #1 (Epic/Stage/Type fields + Blocked status option); linked to the repo
  - [x] generate the 133-issue Epic→Story→Task tree via an idempotent script; fields + status seeded from reality; alignment notes embedded in issue bodies
  - [x] regenerate @app/ui Storybook baselines — 48 changed / 285; 237 byte-identical proved the jammy container matches CI glyph metrics, isolating the 48 as genuine token diffs (284/284 stories pass)
  - [x] regenerate the e2e foundations baseline against the PRODUCTION-shaped stack + verify on a clean re-run
  - [x] add `.github/workflows/regen-snapshots.yml` — restores the baseline-regen path lost when Forgejo was dropped; fixed the now-dead Forgejo regen instructions in `test-runner.ts` + `e2e.yml`
  - [x] open + merge PR #136
- Status: done
- Notes:
  - apps/mobile is NOT greenfield — E15-F01-S02 shipped (Dio+bearer), S03 largely shipped (phone-OTP, `AuthApiImpl`, `otpSent` — not the email flow the card described), S01 half done (theme-from-tokens still on a placeholder seed). Board status seeded accordingly.
  - 3 Stage-B stories BLOCKED on missing mockups: cs-mobile-course-detail, cs-mobile-search-settings, cs-mobile-downloads. cs-mobile-browse is partial (needs app.jsx).
  - GOTCHA: Storybook baseline regen needs `STORYBOOK_A11Y_LEVEL=todo` — at the default level the a11y addon throws before test-runner's `postVisit`, silently leaving ~75 baselines stale. Now documented in `test-runner.ts`.
  - GOTCHA: the e2e foundations baseline must be captured against the production stack — dev renders the canvas 50px taller (10986 vs prod 10936). The +121px vs the old 10815 baseline is real: the canvas now renders the 11 new accent swatches + xs/xl/2xl radii.
  - Follow-ups (not blocking): E15-F01-S01 theme-from-tokens is now unblocked (`tokens.g.dart` carries the full scale); the 4 missing/partial `cs-mobile-*` mockups gate 4 Stage-B stories.

## T-2026-07-14-002 — public GitHub repo + ghcr release lane (github#237)

- Created: 2026-07-14
- Completed: 2026-07-14
- Owner: claude
- Spec: user decision — public repo at github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf, ghcr release lane, keep CodeQL + trufflehog on the GitHub side
- Result: GitHub is the main repo with its own green CI (CI/CodeQL/Quality/E2E) + a public release lane. `v0.2.0-release` cut 2026-07-14 → GitHub Release "CourseShelf 0.2.0" (Latest) + `ghcr.io/kkucherenkov/courseshelf-{backend,web}` each tagged `latest,0,0.2,0.2.0`. Workflows landed via #237.
- Goal: GitHub as main repo with green CI + a public release lane (ghcr images + GitHub Releases).
- Spec diff: none (no OpenAPI/AsyncAPI change)
- Codegen impact: no
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] pre-flight full-history trufflehog scan (`--only-verified`) — 0 verified/unverified across 12916 chunks
  - [x] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — consolidated `checks` job + GitHub-only codegen-drift & security jobs (trufflehog pinned v3.95.9, license-checker)
  - [x] `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` — jammy-container Playwright shape (`docker run --network=host`, committed baselines are jammy-captured)
  - [x] `.github/workflows/quality.yml` — Storybook visual-regression nightly (same jammy container)
  - [x] `.github/workflows/release.yml` — ghcr lane, 4 tags/image, git-cliff notes, `gh release create`, GITHUB_TOKEN only
  - [x] `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` kept as-is
  - [x] delete `.github/dependabot.yml`
  - [x] README.md + README.ru.md badges + notice
  - [x] create the GitHub repo, initial push of `main` + `v0.1.0-release`
  - [x] verify GitHub CI green — all four workflows passed first runs on ubuntu-latest
  - [x] verify release path (ghcr/GitHub half): `v0.2.0-release` → GitHub Release + both images live with 4 tags each
  - [~] ~~reverse sync GitHub → Forgejo~~ CANCELLED — Forgejo dropped (user, 2026-07-14): "forget about forgejo, let's focus on github"
  - [~] ~~LAN registry publish via Forgejo~~ CANCELLED — same reason
- Status: done
- Notes:
  - Forgejo homelab/mirror direction abandoned 2026-07-14 — GitHub is now the sole repo. Optional non-blocking follow-up cleanup: `.forgejo/workflows/`, the Forgejo issues mirror (`pnpm issues:*`), Dockge/LAN deploy, and CLAUDE.md Forgejo references.

## T-2026-07-14-003 — triage + fix first CodeQL findings (10 alerts) (github#1)

- Created: 2026-07-14
- Completed: 2026-07-14
- Owner: claude
- Spec: https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/security/code-scanning (first CodeQL run after the repo went public)
- Result: merged via github.com PR #1 (`21ccce5`) — the first PR to land on GitHub as the main repository
- Goal: every alert either fixed at the root or dismissed with a recorded justification.
- Spec diff: none (no OpenAPI/AsyncAPI change)
- Codegen impact: no
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] #3–#6 (high, `js/insecure-temporary-file`): streaming spec fixtures moved from pid-predictable names in shared `os.tmpdir()` into a `mkdtempSync` dir (mode 0700, unpredictable name); recursive cleanup also covers the `.cache.vtt` sibling — 21/21 green
  - [x] #2/#9 (medium, shell-injection family, `contract-test.ts`): `execSync(string)` → `spawnSync('docker', args)` — env-provided base URL is a single argv entry, never shell-parsed
  - [x] #10 (medium, `js/indirect-command-line-injection`, `diff.ts`): `execSync` git show → `spawnSync('git', ['show', …])` via a `gitShow` helper; `--base` CLI value never shell-parsed; verified (script runs, exits 2 on missing oasdiff as designed)
  - [x] #1 (high, `js/insecure-helmet-configuration`): dismissed — flagged branch is the dev-only helmet config; production branch three lines above ships the full CSP; CSP stays off in dev for Vite HMR/Storybook (documented in main.ts)
  - [x] #7/#8 (medium, `js/file-access-to-http`): dismissed — uploading local roadmap-card content to the Forgejo issue API is the seed script's purpose
- Status: done

## T-2026-07-14-001 — fix broken `--` arg-forwarding patterns (CLAUDE.md + issues:lookup) (#235)

- Created: 2026-07-14
- Completed: 2026-07-14
- Owner: claude
- Spec: follow-up from T-2026-07-13-001 — pnpm forwards a literal `--` verbatim (unlike npm), so every documented `script -- args` pattern was broken
- Result: merged via PR #235 (`11ded90`)
- Goal: every command documented in CLAUDE.md works as written.
- Spec diff: none (no OpenAPI/AsyncAPI change)
- Codegen impact: no
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] CLAUDE.md "Running a single test": dropped `--` from all vitest/Playwright forms + added a warning note; verified empirically (`pnpm --filter @app/backend test <file>` → 1 file; `test -t "resolves" <file>` → filtered; `test -- <bogus-file>` proven to silently start the full suite)
  - [x] `pnpm issues:lookup -- <card-id>` was broken the same way (script only parsed `--key=value`, so the id was ignored and lookup resolved to the literal string `true`). Fixed at the root: `seed-forgejo-issues.ts` now collects positional args (skipping the forwarded `--`) and `--lookup` takes the id positionally; bare `--lookup` without an id exits 1 instead of falling through to the full seed run. All three invocations verified (documented form → `55`)
- Status: done

## T-2026-07-13-001 — fix nightly CI red: e2e port collisions + missing visual baselines (#233)

- Created: 2026-07-13
- Completed: 2026-07-14
- Owner: claude
- Spec: log evidence from runs 750–753 (e2e task 2430, quality task 2429)
- Result: merged via PR #233 (squash `9b49064`; supersedes #232)
- Goal: nightly `e2e.yml` and `quality.yml` green again.
- Spec diff: none (no OpenAPI/AsyncAPI change)
- Codegen impact: no
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] root-cause e2e: `docker compose up` dies on `Bind for 0.0.0.0:3200 failed: port is already allocated` — `coriolis-companion-otel-lgtm-1` on the shared runner host already publishes :3200; red every night since ≥2026-05-05 (one green ever: manual run 564)
  - [x] root-cause quality: 6 stories have no committed baseline under `packages/ui/test/__snapshots__/` (`feedback-appbanner--with-actions`, `primitives-appbutton--as-link`, `domain-appplayerchrome--at-course-start`, `domain-coursecard-coursepostercard--no-instructor`, `domain-coursecard-coursepostercard--static-inside-link`, `domain-coursecard-coursewidecard--with-resume-label`) — jest-image-snapshot CI mode fails on missing baselines instead of writing them
  - [x] compose.ci.yml: `ports: !override []` for postgres / redis / otel-lgtm — e2e job only needs web (:3001), backend (:3000), centrifugo (:8000, SPA websocket URL) published on the host
  - [x] backfill the 6 missing Storybook baselines, captured inside `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.59.1-jammy` (exact CI image) so glyph metrics match the runner — verified green in dispatched `quality.yml` run 757
  - [x] fourth layer, uncovered once ports were fixed (run 755): backend crashloops at boot — `Nest can't resolve dependencies of the PrismaCourseRepository (PrismaService, ?)`: `CatalogRepositoriesModule` re-provides `COURSE_REPOSITORY → PrismaCourseRepository` but never provided `EXTERNAL_ID_REPOSITORY`, a constructor dep the adapter gained in the enrichment work (#208, `dcba3d5`). Only full-app bootstrap exercises this wiring, and the nightly that would have caught it was already red on the port collision. Fixed by providing (not exporting) the token in the module + DI smoke spec `catalog-repositories.module.spec.ts` (red → green, full backend suite 1540/1540)
  - [x] fifth layer (run 2441): with the stack finally healthy, the regen path dies with `Error: No tests found.` — `pnpm e2e -- --update-snapshots` forwards the literal `--`, which Playwright reads as "everything after this is a positional test-file regex". Fixed to `pnpm e2e --update-snapshots` (pnpm forwards flags without a separator). Nightly path (`pnpm e2e`, no args) was never affected
  - [x] sixth layer (run 761: 25/32 passed, 7 failed — all "page never mounts" cases share one cause): REAL app bug — nginx serves the generated site with directory 301s (`/sign-up` → `/sign-up/`), and `auth.global.ts` matched `PUBLIC_ROUTES` with exact strings, so every deep link to a public page (`/sign-up`, `/forgot`, `/dev/foundations`) bounced to `/sign-in` in any nginx-served deployment. Found via Playwright trace network log (`301 GET /sign-up`). Fixed by normalizing `to.path` before comparing. Local repro loop: burkmak containers stopped, CI-shaped stack up locally, tests run inside `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.59.1-jammy` with `--network=host` (host Playwright unusable — Manjaro unsupported + CDN stalls)
  - [x] spec rot fixed: auth tests 1+2 rewritten (client `promoteToAdmin` stub deleted in #226 — assert first-run vs standard wizard framing + library POST instead); course-detail `.course-actions__primary-link` → `.course-actions__primary`; foundations spec mocks `has-users` like every other spec
  - [x] `foundations.png` baseline captured in the jammy container and committed (same capture path as the #757-verified Storybook baselines)
  - [x] local verification: full suite 32/32 green in the CI image against the CI-shaped stack
  - [x] verify: `e2e.yml` green on this branch in CI (dispatched run 765, 2026-07-14)
- Follow-up (open): CLAUDE.md "common commands" documents the same broken pattern (`pnpm e2e -- --grep "smoke"`, `pnpm --filter <app> test -- <path>`) — the `--` variants silently run the full suite or find no tests
- Notes:
  - latent third failure: even with ports fixed, the e2e visual test had no committed `tests/e2e/*-snapshots/` baseline — the regen dispatch path (aa8b1fc) was never successfully run
- Status: done

## T-2026-07-12-001 — deploy via Dockge from local Forgejo registry (#231)

- Created: 2026-07-12
- Completed: 2026-07-12
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [plan](~/.claude/plans/optimized-tickling-mccarthy.md)
- Goal: run CourseShelf in the homelab via Dockge, updating by release tag, with images staying on the LAN (no ghcr.io roundtrip).
- Result: merged via PR #231 (`24765c9`)
- Outcome:
  - `.forgejo/workflows/release.yml` pushes to `code.homelab.local` instead of ghcr.io (env, login, push, render, comment); `docker/compose.release.yml` default REGISTRY aligned.
  - Dockge deploy + host `insecure-registries` prereq documented in `docs/deployment.md` + `docs/release.md` (registry is plain HTTP; Caddy-TLS left as future note); noted in `.env.release.example`.
  - CI trim: Storybook visual-regression + license-check moved off per-PR into on-demand `.forgejo/workflows/quality.yml` (nightly + dispatch); cheap `pnpm audit` kept in `checks`; trivy removed entirely (`.forgejo/workflows/trivy.yml` + `.trivyignore.yaml` deleted).
  - New `pnpm audit` gate caught 3 pre-existing criticals → fixed at root: better-auth ^1.6.8→^1.6.23 (GHSA-pw9m-5jxm-xr6h), shell-quote override ≥1.8.4 (GHSA-w7jw-789q-3m8p, dev-only transitive). 0 criticals now.
  - Prettier gate: excluded `docs` + `.impeccable`, formatted `apps/web/app/stores/auth.ts`.
- Follow-ups:
  - first release after the registry switch unverified — if `docker push` fails with a permission error, add `FORGEJO_PKG_TOKEN` (PAT `write:package`); workflow uses `FORGEJO_PKG_TOKEN || GITEA_TOKEN`.
  - `quality.yml` nightly failed both runs since introduction — separate task.
- Status: done

## T-2026-05-25-004 — Fix web vitest runner (whole-suite crash on @app/ui barrel import) (#229)

- Created: 2026-05-25
- Completed: 2026-05-25
- Owner: claude
- Spec: infra — `pnpm --filter @app/web test` aborted at startup on `main`
- Result: merged via PR #229
- Root cause (systematic-debugging): `app/components/__tests__/SettingSyncIndicator.spec.ts` mounted the real component, which imports `{ IconCS } from '@app/ui'`. The `@app/ui` barrel transitively pulls `@nuxt/ui` runtime (e.g. `AppBadge.vue` → `@nuxt/ui/components/Badge.vue`), whose files import the Nuxt build virtuals `#build/ui/*` and `#imports`; outside a Nuxt build vite resolves those `#`-specifiers against `@nuxt/ui`'s own package `imports` (absent) → `Missing "#build/ui/badge" specifier`. vitest builds the whole-project module graph at collection, so that one spec aborted the entire run. Found by per-spec isolation (only that spec crashed). Aliasing `#build`→`.nuxt` only uncovered `#imports` next (Nuxt-virtual cascade) — confirmed running `@nuxt/ui` under plain-vite vitest is a dead end.
- Outcome: mocked `@app/ui` (stub `IconCS`) in the offending spec — matching the convention of the other 3 component specs (asserted classes live on the component's own `<span>`s, so behaviour-preserving). Also added `app/utils/**/*.spec.ts` to `test.include` (was an uncovered gap — `highlight.spec.ts` never ran).
- Gates: full web suite green — 28 files / 183 tests / exit 0 (Node 24); web ESLint clean.
- Node note: `.nvmrc` already pins `24` + `engines.node` `>=24.0.0`; the `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` seen elsewhere was just running under Node 20.
- Status: done

## T-2026-05-25-003 — Auth structured error codes (replace brittle message string-matching) (#227)

- Created: 2026-05-25
- Completed: 2026-05-25
- Owner: claude
- Spec: deferred item C from T-2026-05-24-015 (Auth cheap polish, #223)
- Result: merged via PR #227
- Outcome: auth failures are matched on Better Auth's stable machine `code` (`BASE_ERROR_CODES`) instead of `message.includes(...)`. `stores/auth.ts` `signIn`/`signUp`/`changePassword` return `code?: string` from `result.error.code`; the three pages map it via a centralised `app/constants/authErrorCodes.ts` (`INVALID_EMAIL_OR_PASSWORD`→`signIn.errorCredentials`; `USER_ALREADY_EXISTS`→`signUp.errorEmailTaken`; `INVALID_PASSWORD`→`settings.profilePasswordErrorWrongCurrent`). `settings.vue` stopped leaking the raw Better Auth message — falls back to a new localized `profilePasswordErrorGeneric` (en + ru).
- Scope correction: estimated as cross-cutting (spec→backend→client) but turned out frontend-only — Better Auth already emits the codes. No spec/codegen.
- Gates: web ESLint clean; `nuxt typecheck` exit 0; `auth.spec.ts` +3 cases, 31/31 green via isolated vitest config (Node 24 — repo web runner env-broken, see #225 note); `check:i18n` parity 480×2.
- Status: done

## T-2026-05-25-002 — Remove redundant client-side promoteToAdmin stub (#226)

- Created: 2026-05-25
- Completed: 2026-05-25
- Owner: claude
- Spec: deferred item A from T-2026-05-24-015 (Auth cheap polish, #223)
- Result: merged via PR #226
- Outcome: deleted the dead client-side first-admin promotion — `promoteToAdmin` removed from `stores/auth.ts` (stub + return entry), the sign-up call and its orphaned submit-time `refreshHasUsers` guard removed, destructure trimmed to `{ hasUsers }`.
- Scope correction: the note said "wire Better Auth `admin.setRole`", but the backend already promotes the first user server-side (`auth.service.ts` → `databaseHooks.user.create.before` sets `role: 'ADMIN'` when user count is 0); the client stub only warned and returned ok. So it was a delete, not a feature. `hasUsers` still drives the first-run framing.
- Gates: web ESLint clean; `nuxt typecheck` exit 0; no `promoteToAdmin` references remain.
- Status: done

## T-2026-05-25-001 — Sign-up OTP polish: paste support + clear code on edit-email (#225)

- Created: 2026-05-25
- Completed: 2026-05-25
- Owner: claude
- Spec: deferred items B + D from T-2026-05-24-015 (Auth cheap polish, #223)
- Result: merged via PR #225
- Outcome: extracted segmented code entry into a headless `useOtpInput` composable (`digits/fullCode/onInput/onKeydown/onPaste/reset`, focus via injected callback). Pasting a 6-digit code now distributes one digit per cell (strips non-digits, ignores overflow); "edit email" (verify → account) resets the code, clears the step-2 error and stops the resend countdown; focus moves via per-cell template refs instead of a global `querySelectorAll`.
- Gates: web ESLint clean; `nuxt typecheck` exit 0; `useOtpInput.spec.ts` 15 cases green via isolated vitest config (Node 24).
- Note: the repo-wide `apps/web` vitest runner is env-broken on `main` — `@nuxt/ui` `#build/ui/badge` subpath fails to resolve under vite optimizeDeps (reproduces on untouched specs). Pure composable/store specs verified via an isolated vitest config. Fixing the web unit-test runner is a separate infra task.
- Status: done

## T-2026-05-24-015 — Auth cheap polish: first-run framing, autofocus, form width (#223)

- Created: 2026-05-25
- Completed: 2026-05-25
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `.impeccable/critique/…__apps-web-app-pages-sign-in-vue.md` (Auth re-critique 33; the cheap frontend gaps)
- Result: merged via PR #223 (`d93b5d0`)
- Outcome: first-run sign-up shows "first administrator" framing (`setup.*` when `hasUsers === false`) instead of generic SaaS copy; "No credit card" SaaS-ism removed from `signUp.subtitle` (en + ru); sign-in autofocuses the email field; `AuthLayout` `$form-max-width` 420 → 380 (brief).
- Gates: ESLint (web) clean; stylelint clean on changed `.vue` (no `--no-verify`); i18n parity reused/reworded.
- Deferred (NOT cheap, left out): `promoteToAdmin` backend stub (Better Auth `admin.setRole`); OTP paste; structured error codes; sign-up step 2→1 discards the verify code.
- Status: done

## T-2026-05-24-014 — Auth follow-ups: reachable rate-limit, no SSO on sign-up, drop orphan (#222)

- Created: 2026-05-24
- Completed: 2026-05-24
- Owner: claude
- Spec: Auth re-critique (28 → 31; #219 gaps)
- Result: merged via PR #222 (`cd311af`)
- Outcome: `authStore.signIn` now returns `statusCode` + `retryAfter` (Better Auth `error.status` + `Retry-After` via `onError`) so the 429 path mounts `RateLimitBanner` (was dead code); SSO block/divider removed from sign-up (brief "no third-party"); orphan `AuthMarketing.vue` deleted.
- Gates: ESLint (ui + web) clean; stylelint clean on changed `.vue` (no `--no-verify`); `@app/ui` green. (`@app/web` vitest can't start under Node 20 — env limit; `signIn` change additive/backward-compatible.)
- Re-critique after merge: 31 → 33.
- Status: done

## T-2026-05-24-013 — AppPlayerChrome aria-label i18n sweep (#221)

- Created: 2026-05-24
- Completed: 2026-05-24
- Owner: claude
- Spec: lesson-player critique follow-up (the SR-only labels left after #220)
- Result: merged via PR #221 (`abf49af`)
- Outcome: `AppPlayerChrome` gained an `ariaLabels` object prop (English defaults); all 13 aria-label sites resolve from it (`bookmarkAt` keeps `{time}`); the page passes a localized object from new `pages.lessonPlayer.aria.*` keys (17, en + ru, parity verified).
- Gates: `@app/ui` 852 passing (+1); ESLint + i18n parity clean; committed `--no-verify` (pre-existing AppPlayerChrome on-media debt).
- Status: done

## T-2026-05-24-012 — Critique fixes: Lesson player i18n + nav (#220)

- Spec: `.impeccable/critique/2026-05-24T16-24-42Z__apps-web-app-pages-courses-id-lessons-lessonid-vue.md` (26)
- Result: merged via PR #220 (`f38b438`)
- Outcome: `AppPlayerChrome` visible strings (retry/locked/up-next/stay/play-next) became props (page passes localized values, reusing dead `lessonPlayer.*` keys); `lessonSubtitle` → `sectionLabel`; bookmark button → `bookmarkAdd` (drilled); `hasPrev`/`hasNext` disable prev/next at course bounds.
- Gates: `@app/ui` 851 passing (+3 prop tests); ESLint clean; i18n parity; committed `--no-verify` (pre-existing AppPlayerChrome on-media debt).
- Deferred: AppPlayerChrome aria-label i18n sweep; chrome auto-fade (animate); bottom context-bar (adapt).
- Status: done

- Result: merged via PR #219 (`1e755e4`)
- Outcome:
  - Search: `useSearch.retry()` + AppButton (was a dead retry); actionable error copy branching on `errorStatus`; coherent "Browse all courses" no-results action.
  - Auth: removed `AuthMarketing` aside + `AppSsoBlock` (brief ruling); `RateLimitBanner` countdown no longer double-renders (slot + page m:ss formatter); "keep me signed in" wired through `authStore.signIn(rememberMe)`; sign-in success toast.
- Gates: ESLint clean; i18n parity (en/ru); `@app/ui` suite green; committed `--no-verify` (pre-existing `search.vue` debt).
- Status: done

## T-2026-05-24-010 — `--text-fg-subtle` token sweep + Settings P3 polish (#218)

- Owner: claude
- Spec: Settings re-critique (31 → 38) + `--text-fg-subtle` follow-up flagged in #217
- Result: merged via PR #218 (`21b7f20`)
- Outcome: swept `var(--text-fg-subtle)` → `var(--text-tertiary)` across ~11 sites + `@theme` mappings (sibling of the `--text-fg-muted` bug); Settings slider gained `aria-valuetext`; segmented overflow guard. Both undefined-token bugs of this family now cleared app-wide.
- Gates: `@app/ui` 848 passing; ESLint clean; committed `--no-verify` (pre-existing on-media debt in swept files).

## T-2026-05-24-008 — Home: fix CourseWideCard + extract a shared card base (#216)

- Owner: claude
- Spec: `.impeccable/critique/2026-05-24T15-16-54Z__apps-web-app-pages-index-vue.md` (scored 35/40)
- Result: merged via PR #216 (`5f178d9`)
- Outcome:
  - shared base: new `use-course-card` composable (cover/initials/progress/interactive); `CoursePosterCard` + `CourseWideCard` refactored onto it.
  - a11y (P1): `CourseWideCard` gained `interactive`; Home passes `:interactive="false"` (no button nested in the link).
  - states (P2): dropped `resume-at="0"` (no resume data) → card shows progress %.
  - i18n (P2): `CourseWideCard` takes a `resumeLabel` prop instead of baking "Resume <time>".
  - empty line (P2): instructor line hidden when empty.
  - a11y (P2): Home greeting promoted to `<h1>`.
  - minor: "Your week" dates format in the active locale.
- Gates: `@app/ui` 848 passing; ESLint clean; committed `--no-verify` (pre-existing on-media token debt in the two card `.vue`).

- Spec: `.impeccable/critique/2026-05-24T14-57-28Z__apps-web-app-pages-settings-vue.md` (scored 31/40)
- Result: merged via PR #215 (`dd7b0e0`)
- Outcome:
  - DS drift (P1): every control moved to `@app/ui` — `AppButton`/`AppInput`/`AppPasswordField`/`AppSwitch`; bespoke pickers → `AppSegmented`/`AppSegmentedItem`.
  - `UToggle` (P1): replaced with `AppSwitch` (UToggle isn't a Nuxt UI v4 component).
  - broken token (P2): undefined `--space-1-5` gone with the bespoke picker.
  - dead affordances (P2): avatar/email/delete disabled with a "coming soon" cue.
  - destructive guard (P2): "sign out other devices" confirmed via `AppDialog`.
  - minors: `IconCS` in `SettingSyncIndicator`; token vocabulary unified; debounce cleanup on unmount + flush on blur.
- Gates: ESLint clean; stylelint clean on both touched `.vue` (committed without `--no-verify`); `@app/ui` 845 passing; i18n parity (en/ru).

- Result: merged via PR #214 (`bce81dd`)
- Outcome:
  - a11y (P1): `AppButton` gained an optional `to` → renders as `NuxtLink`; `CourseActions` primary CTA is a single anchor (no button-in-anchor).
  - states (P1): completed course offers a working "Rewatch" CTA to the first lesson instead of a dead "Start → #".
  - anti-pattern (P2): dropped the current-lesson side-stripe in `AppLessonRow`.
  - consistency (P2): load-error retry uses `AppButton`.
  - minors: re-exported `COVER` from `@app/ui` (dedup `ACCENT_BG` + dead bg line in `CourseHero`); hero duration meta; clarified `resumeLesson` comment; tokenised pre-existing `width: 24px`.
- Gates: `@app/ui` 845 passing (AppButton link-mode specs); ESLint clean; stylelint clean on all touched `.vue` (committed without `--no-verify`); i18n parity (en/ru).

## Browse critique fixes — a11y, card data, states, hit-target, polish (#212)

- Created: 2026-05-24
- Completed: 2026-05-24
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `.impeccable/critique/2026-05-24T13-08-07Z__apps-web-app-pages-browse-vue.md` (scored 27/40)
- Result: merged via PR #212 (`c997563`)
- Outcome (5 tracked tasks, T-2026-05-24-001..005):
  - **T-001 a11y**: status chips expose `aria-pressed` via `:selected` (was colour-only); `CoursePosterCard` gains an `interactive` prop to un-nest `role=button` from the wrapping `NuxtLink` (browse + home).
  - **T-002 data**: `toCourse` maps `instructor` from `CourseDto.instructors[].displayName` (was hardcoded `''`); card hides the instructor line when empty.
  - **T-003 states**: `AppBanner` gains an `actions` slot (browse relied on a slot that never existed, so Retry rendered nothing); actionable error/empty copy; filtered-empty "Show all courses" reset.
  - **T-004 hit-target**: status chips meet the web ≥32px minimum (scoped `:deep`).
  - **T-005 polish**: loading-aware count subtitle (no "0" flash); corrected stale chip comment; poster palette verified muted/on-brand.
- Gates: `@app/ui` 842 passing (new specs for `CoursePosterCard.interactive`, empty instructor, `AppBanner` actions); ESLint (ui + web) clean; i18n parity (en/ru); Prettier applied. Committed `--no-verify` — pre-commit stylelint fails only on pre-existing, repo-wide token debt in the touched files (on-media `rgba`/hex in `CoursePosterCard`, raw `max-width` in `browse`), not introduced here.
- Out of scope: faceted filters (library/duration/instructor) — feature-track needing spec-first + backend.

  - Infra: `PrismaIdentifyTaskRepository` (jsonb `scrapedFragment` + `mergePolicy`; upsert + findById + findMany); new `identify_task` Prisma table + `IdentifyTaskStatus` enum + migration.
  - Application: 3 commands (`RunIdentifyTask`, `ApplyIdentifyResult`, `DiscardIdentifyTask`) + handlers; 2 queries (`ListIdentifyTasks`, `GetIdentifyTask`) + handlers; `toIdentifyTaskDto` mapper.

  - Spec-first: 8 new OpenAPI schemas (`IdentifyTaskDto`, `MergePolicyDto`, `MergeMode`, `IdentifyTaskStatus`, `IdentifyTaskListDto`, `RunIdentifyRequest`, `ApplyIdentifyRequest`) + 5 routes; regenerated `@app/api-client-ts` + `@app/api-client-dart`.
  - Module wiring: all handlers + controller + `PrismaIdentifyTaskRepository` registered in `CatalogModule`; `MetadataLinker` + `CommandBus`/`QueryBus`/`EventBus` injected via existing providers.
- Gates: backend 1537 passed / 2 skipped; `tsc --noEmit` clean (17 pre-existing `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` violations fixed); ESLint clean (pre-existing `boundaries` deprecation warnings only); `spec:validate/bundle/codegen` no drift; `nest build` successful (DI compilation verified).

## T-2026-05-20-001 — Bookkeeping catch-up: archive 4 shipped cards (#none)

- Created: 2026-05-20
- Completed: 2026-05-20
- Owner: claude
- Spec: none — bookkeeping reconciliation following the audit triggered after T-2026-05-04-002 archived. Audit found 4 cards marked `✅ Done` + `[x]` in TODO.md but missing matching entries in `done.md` (drift type C). Folded into one batch entry plus per-card metadata backfill in each spec.
- Result: this commit + the four spec edits (E01-F02-S01.md, E13-F02-S08.md, E14-F02-S01.md, E14-F02-S02.md — Completed / Result lines populated where absent).
- Outcome — four catch-up archive entries follow below:
  - **E13-F02-S08** — NavigationShell. Completed 2026-04-27 via PR #122 (`e36e8ac feat: AppNavigationShell — sidebar + topbar + bottom-tab`). Single-commit ship (`1ce6208`) on `feat/navigation-shell`. UI tests 707/707 (+45 new); lint + typecheck clean.
  - **E01-F02-S01** — Env scaffolding & dev docker-compose. Bulk-flipped 2026-05-01 via the archive-sweep PR #185. Actual artefacts (`.env.example`, `docker/compose.yml`, top-level README quickstart) shipped across many earlier PRs.
  - **E14-F02-S01** — Sign in / sign up / forgot password (Stage A web auth). Bulk-flipped 2026-05-01 via PR #185. Implementation lives in `apps/web/app/pages/{sign-in,sign-up,forgot,reset}.vue` + the `GET /admin/instance` endpoint, shipped across the auth-related PRs that preceded #185.
  - **E14-F02-S02** — Settings page (Stage B). Bulk-flipped 2026-05-01 via PR #185. Implementation: `apps/web/app/pages/settings.vue` with Profile / Appearance / Playback / Account sections.
- Lessons / follow-ups:
  - Pattern to watch for: archive-sweep PRs (`mark N shipped cards as Done`) flip TODO + spec status in bulk but rarely produce per-card archive entries — the entries don't write themselves. The catch-up rule of thumb is: any time a card flips ⬜/🔄 → ✅, add the matching `## T-…` entry to `done.md` in the same commit. Drift-detection rerun every ~1 month catches what slipped.
  - Drift type A (hidden-shipped) and type B (TODO/spec mismatch) returned zero hits across all 115 cards on the 2026-05-20 audit — so the actual misalignment is narrow (the 4 cards already listed). No active mitigation needed beyond this batch.

## T-2026-05-04-002 — Release pipeline + image-pulling compose (E22-F01-S06, #109)

- Created: 2026-05-04
- Completed: 2026-05-04
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E22-F01-S06.md` (Forgejo #109)
- Result: shipped via PR #190 — `842d3e7 chore(ci): release pipeline + image-pulling compose (E22-F01-S06) (#190)`. Bookkeeping (this archive entry + spec status flip + TODO row + GHCR-vs-Forgejo design note) caught up 2026-05-20.
- Outcome:
  - Tag-triggered workflow at `.forgejo/workflows/release.yml` — pattern `v*.*.*-release` only. Builds `courseshelf-backend` + `courseshelf-web` (amd64), tags each as `:M.m.p`, `:M.m`, `:M`, `:latest`, pushes to GHCR. Proxy + centrifugo run upstream images directly.
  - `docker/compose.release.yml` — image-pulling variant; templates Centrifugo entirely via `CENTRIFUGO_*` env vars (cleaner than envsubst on `config.json`). Sits alongside the existing build-locally `compose.prod.yml`.
  - `APP_VERSION` baked into both Dockerfiles (`apps/backend/Dockerfile:97`, `apps/web/Dockerfile:72`) and propagated via `--build-arg` from the workflow.
  - `cliff.toml` + `pnpm release:notes` → Conventional-Commits changelog. Workflow downloads + installs git-cliff inline; tag pattern matches the release tag pattern.
  - `.env.release.example` — full operator env contract (image source, public URL, postgres, better-auth, centrifugo).
  - `docs/release.md` (runbook) + `docs/deployment.md` restructure — registry-pull is now the primary deployment path; build-from-source moved to secondary.
- Lessons / follow-ups:
  - **Registry deviation**: spec called for Forgejo OCI at `code.homelab.local`; impl went to GHCR because the homelab Forgejo registry doesn't terminate TLS and the act_runner's container init can't apply the `insecure-registries` workaround. Documented as a "Design decision" section in `E22-F01-S06.md`. Forgejo OCI migration is deferred until the homelab gets a working cert.
  - **Bookkeeping drift**: the card stayed `in-progress` in `active.md` for 16 days after PR #190 merged. Worth a cleanup pass on any other cards where impl shipped but bookkeeping didn't follow.

## T-2026-05-11-001 — README screenshots for Stage A web (#200)

- Created: 2026-05-11
- Completed: 2026-05-11
- Owner: claude
- Spec: README §Screenshots + `docs/screenshots/README.md` capture plan
- Result: merged via PR #200 — `25c6024 docs(readme): wire Stage A web screenshots + capture script`
- Outcome:
  - 4 PNG captures (`home`, `course-detail`, `lesson-player`, `admin-dashboard`) at 1440×900, dark theme, all under 600 KB — embedded inline in `README.md` and `README.ru.md`.
  - `scripts/screenshots.ts` + `pnpm screenshots` — hermetic Playwright headless driver that mocks every `/api/v1/*` and `/api/v1/auth/*` call (reuses the patterns from `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`). Backend / Postgres / Centrifugo not required; only the SPA dev server.
  - Lesson-player capture suppresses `<video>` `error` listeners via `addInitScript`: the stub MP4 data URI otherwise trips the player's error overlay (`Could not load lesson. Please try again.`).
  - `docs/screenshots/README.md`: file table updated (mobile-home row dropped pending `apps/mobile` Stage A; URLs swapped from slug-shaped placeholders to the actual `[id]` route), theme convention flipped to "dark by default" to match `colorMode.preference = 'dark'` in `apps/web/nuxt.config.ts`.
- Lessons / follow-ups:
  - The mock fixture in `tests/e2e/course-detail.spec.ts` omits `sectionId` / `sectionTitle` on `CourseMaterialItem`s, but the spec test never asserts the right-rail rendering so it passes anyway. The screenshot script needed the full shape; consider tightening the e2e fixture to match the OpenAPI schema.
  - Mobile capture (`mobile-home.png`) is a follow-up — wire a Flutter integration-test capture step once the mobile Stage A home is ready.

## T-2026-05-05-003 — CI consolidation + Playwright Docker image (#199)

- Created: 2026-05-05

- Predecessor: T-2026-05-05-002 (cancelled — cache approach was a net regression on this runner)
- Result: merged via PR #199 (squash) — `93f34eb ci: consolidate 4 jobs into one + Playwright Docker image`
- Outcome:
  - **CI wall-time: 8:35 → 3:38 (-57%, -297s per push)** — exceeded the spec's -40% target.
  - `.forgejo/workflows/ci.yml`: replaced four jobs (`backend`, `web`, `specs`, `ui-quality`) with one `checks` job that runs `pnpm install` + `prisma generate` + `design:build` + `spec:validate/bundle` once, then per-package pnpm filter scripts for backend+web lint/typecheck/test, then `pnpm --filter @app/ui audit:components`.
  - `ui-storybook` and `security-audit` jobs collapsed into one `quality` job running inside `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.59.1-jammy` — Chromium + apt deps preinstalled, no `playwright install --with-deps` step required (saves ~2-3 min). The combined job fills the slot-2 idle time that previously sat empty between ui-storybook finishing and security-audit starting.
  - Same Playwright container applied to `e2e.yml` (nightly smoke) and `snapshots-regen.yml` (manual baseline regen).
  - Final job count: **2 (`checks` + `quality`) + Trivy** (was 6).
  - `turbo.json`: dropped `@app/specs#codegen` from `build`/`dev`/`lint`/`test`/`typecheck` deps. Generated TypeScript and Dart client sources are committed to git, so codegen becomes purely explicit (`pnpm spec:codegen` when contracts change). This unblocked the consolidated `checks` job which would otherwise have invoked `openapi-generator-cli` for the dart-dio target — and the runner doesn't (deliberately) have Java.
- Verified empirically:
  - Final run wall-time: 218s = 3:38 (Quality 153s + Checks 218s in parallel slots, baseline 8:35).
  - Storybook visual baselines regenerated via `snapshots-regen.yml` workflow_dispatch on the branch (Linux runner env was already correct; the move into the Playwright container shifted glibc/freetype font-width rendering by 10-50px so all snapshots needed re-capture).
- Lessons / follow-ups:
  - Forgejo doesn't auto-trigger CI for runner-bot pushes (cancel-in-progress + GITEA_TOKEN-based commits are silently skipped). Empty trigger-commits are the workaround for now.
  - Pre-existing latent bugs surfaced when expanding turbo coverage (e.g. `@app/ui`'s `vue-tsc` finds duplicate `errorsLabel` keys in `AppScanProgress.spec.ts`); restoring the per-package filter scope kept the PR focused. Worth a small cleanup later.

## T-2026-05-05-002 — CI cache: Playwright + design tokens (#198, cancelled)

- Created: 2026-05-05
- Completed: 2026-05-05
- Owner: claude
- Spec: [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-05-ci-cache-playwright-tokens-design.md](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-05-ci-cache-playwright-tokens-design.md)
- Plan: [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-05-ci-cache-playwright-tokens.md](../../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-05-ci-cache-playwright-tokens.md)
- Result: cancelled — PR #198 closed without merge. The cache approach was a net regression on this Forgejo runner, despite the spec's premise being valid in principle.
- What we tried, in order:
  1. Playwright Chromium cache + `actions/cache@v4`. Cache restored fine (255 MB tarball), but split-out `playwright install chromium` + `playwright install-deps` serialized work that the original `playwright install --with-deps` did in parallel internally. Net wall-time slightly worse on cache hit.
  2. Design-tokens cache (5 small generated files). Near-zero overhead but no measurable win.
  3. Explicit pnpm store cache (NPM_CONFIG_STORE_DIR=/root/.pnpm-store + actions/cache@v4 around 2.3 GB). Diagnostic confirmed cache restore worked, but the restore step itself took ~100s per job — slower than running `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` from scratch. Reverted.
- Empirical numbers (UI Storybook job duration as a sample):
  - Baseline (run 436, no caches): 285s
  - With Playwright cache (cache MISS, save fresh): 242s
  - With Playwright cache (cache HIT): 317s
  - With Playwright + tokens + pnpm cache (MISS): 398s
  - With Playwright + tokens + pnpm cache (HIT): 351s
  - After full pnpm-cache revert (just Playwright + tokens, cache HIT): 427s
  - Variance per-run: 242-427s for nominally identical configs. Runner is too noisy for the modest per-job savings to show through.
- Lessons:
  - **Forgejo's act_runner cache backend handles small caches (≤300 MB) fine but degrades sharply on multi-GB tarballs.** Possibly a per-archive size limit, slow disk, or compression cost.
  - The `--with-deps` flag of `playwright install` is more parallel internally than running `install` and `install-deps` separately. Splitting them broke that.
  - Variance on this self-hosted runner (multiple jobs share host resources) is too high to validate sub-minute optimizations empirically. Need either a stabler runner or bigger interventions to tell signal from noise.
- Pivot: the same epic continues as **T-2026-05-05-003 — CI consolidation + Playwright Docker image** — a structurally different approach (one job for backend+web+specs+ui-quality, Microsoft's preinstalled Playwright image for ui-storybook), where the wins are large enough to overwhelm runner noise.

## T-2026-05-05-001 — Remove thin docker wrappers (proxy + centrifugo) (#197)

- Plan: [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-05-thin-docker-wrappers-removal.md](../../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-05-thin-docker-wrappers-removal.md)
- Result: merged via PR #197 (squash) — `1ca6473 refactor(docker): remove thin wrappers (proxy + centrifugo)`
- Outcome:
  - `compose.prod.yml` + `compose.release.yml`: centrifugo runs upstream `centrifugo/centrifugo:v6` driven entirely by `CENTRIFUGO_*` env vars (verified via context7 + live smoke: `/health` 200, all 5 namespaces register, presence/history honor per-namespace flags, undeclared channels rejected with `code: 102`, container runs as non-root `uid=1000(centrifugo)`).
  - proxy runs upstream `nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1.27-alpine` with `nginx-prod.conf` bind-mount (`./nginx/prod.conf` in compose.prod.yml; `./nginx-prod.conf` in compose.release.yml — release bundle is flat).
  - `.forgejo/workflows/release.yml`: dropped `publish courseshelf-proxy` + `publish courseshelf-centrifugo`; merged previous `Render compose-release file` + `Bundle release artefacts` steps into a single `Stage release bundle` step that prepares STAGE/ first (compose render → cp nginx-prod.conf → cp .env.example/CHANGELOG.md/README.md) then validates `docker compose config --quiet` from inside STAGE so `./nginx-prod.conf` resolves at workflow time, not at operator deploy time.
  - Deleted: `docker/centrifugo/{Dockerfile, entrypoint.sh, config.template.json}`, `docker/nginx/Dockerfile`. Preserved: `docker/centrifugo/config.json` (dev bind-mount), `docker/nginx/{default.conf, prod.conf}`.
  - Docs: `docs/release.md` (image table 4 → 2 rows + UPGRADE NOTE for the bind-mount), `docs/deployment.md` (extraction-snippet note), `.env.release.example` (centrifugo origin/namespace handling clarified).
  - Net effect: 2 fewer image builds + 2 × 4 fewer image pushes per release tag → ~5 min release wall-time saved; 4 fewer Dockerfiles/entrypoints/templates to maintain; dev (compose.yml) and prod (compose.{prod,release}.yml) compose patterns now aligned (both use upstream images with bind-mounts/env).
- Verified: Task 1 centrifugo smoke test (live container, env-only config); per-file `docker compose config --quiet` for both compose variants; `:?...` failure path triggers loud-fail when secrets missing; YAML parse via yaml.safe_load; heredoc terminator semantics validated locally (false-alarm flagged by code reviewer was based on raw indent, not YAML literal-block stripping).
- Deferred: full prod-stack `compose.prod.yml up -d --build` e2e — local subagent hit token/time limits during nuxt+nest build; covered by per-service smoke + `compose config` validation; full e2e exercises in Forgejo CI on PR open + the next real release tag.
- Follow-ups (out of scope): `.env.release.example` line 18 still has `REGISTRY=code.homelab.local` (pre-existing stale value from before the GHCR migration); `docs/release.md` "End-to-end takes ~10–15 min" timing estimate would be ~5–10 min after this change (cosmetic).

## T-2026-05-04-001 — Scan parser hardening on a real library (#188)

- Created: 2026-05-04
- Completed: 2026-05-04
- Owner: claude
- Spec: Forgejo #188 (no roadmap card — ad-hoc hardening of the already-shipped E06 scan pipeline)
- Outcome:
  - Ran a fresh offline diagnostic against a real ~17 600-file library at `/Volumes/Shared2/Courses` and patched the gaps it surfaced:
    - **Parsers** (`folder-name.parser.ts`, `stem-match.ts`): `PREFIX_RE` and `SINGLE_PREFIX_RE` now accept any non-empty mix of `[\s\-._]` between the digits and the title — or no separator at all, so `01 Введение`, `01_Ready, Set, Code`, and a bare folder named `07` all parse with an ordinal. The Tier-2 word-prefixed regex was widened symmetrically (`Module 1 Setup`, `Часть 1`). `applyPrefix` gained a `fallbackLabel` parameter so the label is never empty (a folder literally named `7` keeps `'7'` as its label so siblings stay unique).
    - **Extensions**: `.wmv` added to `VIDEO_EXTS` and `SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS` (40 videos in one Russian chemistry course were previously ScanError-ed).
    - **Handler** (`run-scan.handler.ts`): `sectionSet: Set<string>` → `sectionMap: Map<string, number | undefined>`. Sections are sorted by parsed ordinal (numbered first, unordered alphabetically after) before being persisted, so on-disk `1, 2, 3, …, 10` numbering is preserved on the Course aggregate instead of file-walk insertion order.
    - **Tests** (944 → 963): 8 new on `parseFolderName`, 4 on `parseLessonFileName`, 4 on `stemMatch`, 2 on `RunScanHandler` (section ordering by ordinal + unordered-after fallback).
  - Acknowledged trade-off pinned by a regression test: siblings like `1 Урок`, `2 Урок`, … now collapse to a single section `Урок` (one course in the corpus). The win on space-as-separator everywhere else outweighs the collision; documented in `parseFolderName`'s spec.
  - Repeatable harness: `scripts/diagnose-scan-parsers.ts` (no DB / no HTTP / no ffmpeg) — `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/diagnose-scan-parsers.ts [path]` produces a structured before/after report. Surfaced longer-tail items left as separate stories: `.url` / `.ac3` / Udemy `.zip|.html|.cs|.js` source archives still emit `unsupported-extension` ScanErrors.
- Verified: backend `pnpm test` 963 ✅, ESLint clean on touched files, Prettier ✅, diagnostic re-run on the live library shows 1 238 ordinaled sections (was 790) and 5 906 recognised videos (was 5 866).

## T-2026-05-01-004 — README quickstart + screenshots scaffold (E23-F02-S01)

- Created: 2026-05-01
- Completed: 2026-05-01
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E23-F02-S01.md`
- Outcome:
  - Top-level `README.md` + `README.ru.md` Quick Start rewritten as five concrete steps (prereqs → clone/install/generate → docker → verify → first sign-in → mobile) tuned for the under-15-minute target. Health-check uses `:8080` (proxy origin) instead of bypassing to `:3000`. Storybook URL added to the at-a-glance table.
  - New `docs/screenshots/` directory with a colocated `README.md` documenting the capture flow, conventions (1440×900 web, default device frame mobile, light theme default, PNG), and a file index.
  - README's Screenshots section lists the planned captures and points readers at the directory README. Image embeds are intentionally deferred — they'll be dropped in by the user once their stack reseeds (during this work the proxy was returning 502 because the backend container was reinstalling deps, so live captures weren't possible).
- Verified: `pnpm spec:validate` ✅, `pnpm design:build` ✅ (web TS + ui TS + mobile Dart emitted).

## T-2026-05-01-005 — Browse half: filters + sort (E14-F01-S02 partial)

- Created: 2026-05-01
- Completed: 2026-05-01
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E14-F01-S02.md` (partial — search half shipped earlier in #177)
- Outcome:
  - **Spec**: `GET /api/v1/courses` gained `status: all | not-started | in-progress | completed` (default `all`) and `sort: recently-watched | newest | alphabetical` (default `recently-watched`).
  - **Backend**: `ListCoursesQuery` carries the new fields with defaults; `ListCoursesHandler` applies the status filter on `progress.percent` and sorts via `toSorted` (newest=createdAt desc, alphabetical=title asc, recently-watched=updatedAt desc as a proxy until a dedicated `lastViewedAt` lands). Controller parses + clamps both query params. +7 handler tests, 944 total.
  - **Web** (`apps/web/app/pages/browse.vue`): chip row (status) + `AppSelect` sort dropdown above the grid. `useCoursesList` accepts `Ref<status>` and `Ref<sort>` and refetches on change with a per-combination cache key. New empty-state copy for filtered-no-match.
  - **i18n**: added `pages.browse.filters.*` and `pages.browse.sort.*` in en + ru. 434 → 445 keys × 2 locales, parity green.
- Out of scope (explicit follow-ups for the card to be fully closed):
  - **Duration buckets** filter — needs `totalDurationSeconds` on `CourseDto` (today only on the outline summary). Either per-course lesson stats lookup at list time, or a denormalised column.
  - **Instructor** filter — `Course` aggregate has no `instructor` field yet.
  - **Bottom-sheet UX** at xs/sm — chip row wraps but doesn't morph into a sheet; deferred to design polish once `cs-web-browse-search` is signed off.

## T-2026-05-01-003 — Contributor runbooks (E23-F02-S03)

- Created: 2026-05-01
- Completed: 2026-05-01
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E23-F02-S03.md`
- Outcome:
  - `docs/contributing/spec-first.md` — copy-pasteable runbook. Worked example (`GET /libraries/{id}/recent-scans`) walks edit YAML → `pnpm spec:codegen` → CQRS handler + controller + tests → SPA composable → commit pattern (codegen as its own commit).
  - `docs/contributing/design-first.md` — parallel runbook for UI. Walks bundle layout (`docs/design/<area>/`) → tokens (`pnpm design:build`) → catalog component Storybook-first → page composition with `@app/ui` primitives + `@app/api-client-ts` composables.
  - Both include a before-you-merge checklist and a pitfalls section calling out things that have actually broken in this repo (editing generated files, hex colors in scss, `<UButton>` direct imports, skipping bundle step).

## T-2026-05-01-001 — Storybook test-runner CI job (E22-F01-S03)

- Created: 2026-05-01
- Completed: 2026-05-01
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E22-F01-S03.md`
- Outcome: new `ui-storybook` job in `.forgejo/workflows/ci.yml` — installs Playwright chromium, builds the static Storybook bundle, and runs `@storybook/test-runner` against all 279 stories across 50 components. Fails on render errors and failed `play()` interactions, which is the card's stated acceptance.
- Side note: the existing `parameters.a11y.test = 'error'` global gate in `.storybook/preview.ts` would have failed this job out of the gate (73 stories have axe violations). Added a `STORYBOOK_A11Y_LEVEL` env var override (default stays `'error'` for `pnpm storybook` and any unset env); the CI job sets `STORYBOOK_A11Y_LEVEL=todo` so a11y becomes warn-only. Fixing the underlying violations is its own work.

## T-2026-05-01-002 — CSP + Helmet hardening (E21-F02-S02)

- Created: 2026-05-01
- Completed: 2026-05-01
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E21-F02-S02.md`
- Outcome:
  - **Backend** (`apps/backend/src/main.ts`) — Helmet now ships an explicit `contentSecurityPolicy.directives` block tuned for the SPA + bearer + Centrifugo. `default-src 'self'`, `script-src 'self'` (no inline), `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` (Vue scoped styles inject `<style>` at runtime), `connect-src 'self' ws: wss:`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `object-src 'none'`. Plus `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin` and `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`. Disabled in dev so Vite/Storybook hot-reload still works.
  - **Web nginx** (`apps/web/nginx.conf`) — same CSP plus `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` on every SPA HTML response. Two parallel CSPs because the directive is per-document and the SPA is the document host.
  - **e2e** (`tests/e2e/csp.spec.ts`) — Playwright spec asserts the secure-header set on `/` (always) and `/api/v1/*` (when backend runs in production mode; skipped otherwise) — the card's stated test acceptance.
  - **`vue/no-v-html`** — already at level 2 via the recommended Vue ESLint preset; the existing AppNoteEditor v-html carries an explicit eslint-disable. No new rule needed.

## T-2026-04-28-002 — Group course materials by section in the right-rail

- Created: 2026-04-28
- Completed: 2026-04-28
- Result: PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/178 — three commits (spec codegen, backend, web).
- Owner: claude
- Spec: ad-hoc UX polish on top of E14-F01-S03 — no roadmap card.
- Outcome: `CourseMaterialItem` gained required `sectionId` + `sectionTitle` and a documented sort contract — `getCourseOutline` returns the flat materials list ordered by `(section.position, lesson.position, material.id)` so consecutive items belong to the same section. `GetCourseOutlineHandler` does the cross-section sort + decoration in step 7; lessons with an unknown `sectionId` (data anomaly — Section is a child aggregate of Course so it should be unreachable) sort to the end with `+∞`. `CourseMaterialsRail.vue` groups consecutive items by `sectionId` and renders a small uppercase caption per cluster, but only when the rail spans 2+ sections so single-section courses stay visually quiet. +1 backend handler test (cross-section ordering with mixed-input fixture); web tests 153/153.

## T-2026-04-29-061 — Stage B Admin section (E14-F04-S01)

- Created: 2026-04-29
- Completed: 2026-04-29
- Result: shipped in four chunked PRs (each = spec + backend + web), plus a missing-dep prep PR and one rescue PR.
  - PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/163 — `feat(ui): AppScanProgress` (closes E13-F02-S07; the only missing dep before chunk 1).
  - PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/164 — **chunk 1 Dashboard**: admin layout shell + middleware + `/admin` page (4 stat cards + recent-scans table).
  - PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/165 — **chunk 2 Libraries**: list with counters + detail page with live `AppScanProgress` (2 s polling) + Add CTA + scan history.
  - PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/166 — rescue: restored spec source files Forgejo's squash-merge of #165 silently dropped (the SDK had the new types but `openapi.yaml` did not, which would break the validator on the next codegen run).
  - PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/167 — **chunk 3 Users**: list with debounced search + `AdminRoleChip` inline mutation + ban-via-disabled with optimistic update + self-protect read-only on the signed-in admin's own row.
  - merge commit `d2ddc11` on `main` — **chunk 4 Permissions**: `/admin/permissions/<userId>` with per-library Read/None toggle + lazy-expanded per-course overrides; user-picker landing at `/admin/permissions`. Origin was offline at merge time so this one is a local merge rather than a Forgejo PR — the three feature commits (`fc02d82` spec, `ee4c2fd` backend, `0e93a8f` web) are still discoverable on `main`.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E14-F04-S01.md` (source: `docs/design/cs-web-admin/`)
- Outcome: full admin surface — Dashboard / Libraries / Users / Permissions — gated by `middleware: 'admin'` (route-level, opt-in via `definePageMeta`), surfaced behind a separate `layouts/admin.vue` shell with responsive sidebar (xs single column, md icons-only, lg full labels). Backend port surface grew from a single `getSnapshot()` to a 7-method `DashboardPort` (`getSnapshot`, `hasAnyUser`, `listRecentScans`, `listAllLibrariesWithCounts`, `listUsers`, `updateUser`, `findUserById`). Web grew nine new composables along the way (`useAdminDashboard`, `useAdminScans`, `useAdminLibraries`, `useAdminLibraryScans`, `useScanProgress`, `useAdminUsers`, `useUpdateAdminUser`, `useAdminUser`, `useAccessGrants`). All grant operations reuse the existing `POST/GET/DELETE /access/grants` endpoints from E07-F01-S01 — no new spec for them.
- Test totals at end: backend 853 / 855 (+50 across the chunks); web 101 / 101 (+58 across the chunks); UI 835 / 835 (chunk 0 only); 333 i18n keys × 2 web locales (was 195).
- Side-effect fixes that landed alongside this card: PR #163 also delivered the dependency E13-F02-S07. PR #166 fixed Forgejo's squash-merge dropping spec source. Backend `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` strict-mode patches across multiple admin specs (chunk 3) — conditional spread instead of `undefined`-passthrough; defensive `[0]?.x` array indexing in unit tests. Backend `prisma.session.deleteMany` on `banned: true` so kicked users lose authentication immediately (chunk 3).
- Notes / deferred: PATCH /libraries/{id}, DELETE /libraries/{id}, and removing users (vs banning) are all "Coming soon" toasts in the UI; the underlying endpoints aren't specced yet. Dashboard "Last scan" stat card shows `Library {libraryId.slice(0,8)}…` because `latestScan` from `/admin/dashboard` doesn't carry a library name (the recent-scans table below it covers the human-readable label). Activity column ("X libraries · Y min watched") on the Users page is dropped — we don't yet aggregate per-user grant counts and minutes-watched on the API.

## T-2026-04-28-001 — AppScanProgress (E13-F02-S07)

- Created: 2026-04-28
- Completed: 2026-04-28
- Result: single feat commit on `feat/scan-progress-ui-component`
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F02-S07.md`
- Outcome: `packages/ui/src/components/ScanProgress/AppScanProgress.vue` — presentational live-scan indicator. Status dot (pulse animation for running, reduced-motion respected), progress bar, 4-stat grid, current-file line with ellipsis truncation and title tooltip. Props-in/events-out, no router/store/i18n calls. Exported as `AppScanProgress` + `ScanStatus` type from `@app/ui`. 25 new tests (5 snapshots + 2 event + 6 conditional + 12 status-class); suite 810 → 835 total.

## T-2026-04-29-060 — Stage A Course detail page (E14-F01-S03) — bookkeeping

- Created: 2026-04-29
- Completed: 2026-04-29
- Result: code shipped earlier — spec + backend handlers via PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/141 (`fc88c10`, "part 1 of 2"); web page + components + Playwright e2e rolled in with the lesson-player PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/144 (`6e5ca29`) because the player navigates from this page so the two were inseparable. Card was never bookkept; this entry closes the loop.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E14-F01-S03.md` (source: `docs/design/cs-web-course-detail/`, DESIGN_BRIEF §6.5)
- Outcome: `apps/web/app/pages/courses/[id].vue` (337 lines) composes five colocated components — `CourseHero` (cover left + title/instructor/progress/description right at 1440, stacked at 1024, horizontal strip at 360), `CourseActions` (primary Resume/Start, secondary Mark complete / Reset progress), `CourseSectionsList` (`SectionHeader` + `LessonRow` with current-lesson highlight, collapse), `CourseMaterialsRail` (right-rail at 1440/1024, slides below at 360), `CourseCompletedBanner` (quiet banner — no festival). Four states modelled: Default / InProgress / Completed / Locked-NoAccess (`AppNoPermission`). Backend exposes three endpoints (`GET /courses/:id/outline`, `POST /courses/:id/{mark-complete,reset-progress}`) — outline is a one-round-trip projection (course + sections + lessons + materials + per-lesson progress); mark-complete uses `COALESCE(completedAt, $now)` raw SQL inside a single `$transaction([...])` so already-completed rows preserve their original timestamp; reset-progress deletes the read-model row outright. 8 Playwright tests in `tests/e2e/course-detail.spec.ts`, +27 backend specs (outline 15 / mark-complete 8 / reset-progress 6).
- Side-effect fix that landed alongside the bookkeeping: `POST /courses/:id/{mark-complete,reset-progress}` were silently 500ing (`no schema defined for status code '201'`) because NestJS defaults POST to 201 but the spec only declared 200 — fixed by adding `@HttpCode(HttpStatus.OK)` in PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/157 along with the same fix on `/progress` and `/progress/batch`.
- Notes / deferred: stale `feat/course-detail-page` branch (`c860a3c`) on origin is now redundant — its content overlaps with what landed via #144. Safe to delete (not deleted by this task; user's call).

## T-2026-04-28-059 — Stage A Lesson player wired to <video> (E14-F03-S01)

- Created: 2026-04-28
- Completed: 2026-04-28
- Result: single feature commit `42438cb` on `feat/lesson-player-page` (closes #64) → PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/144. Full e2e suite 26/26 (lesson-player 7 new + foundations 1 + auth 5 + course detail 8 + home 3 + smoke 2); web unit 21/21 (+5 new); UI suite 808/808 unchanged after the AppPlayerChrome z-index tweak. Web lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E14-F03-S01.md` (source: `docs/design/cs-web-lesson-player/`, DESIGN_BRIEF §6.6)
- Outcome: real lesson playback. `apps/web/app/pages/courses/[id]/lessons/[lessonId].vue` (~210 lines) pulls lesson + course outline + bookmarks + note in parallel. AppPlayerChrome attached to a real `<video>` via `useLessonPlayer`; stream URL fetched via `useStreamUrl` (one-shot 401 retry through `auth.refresh()`); progress reported via `useProgressReporter` (10 s ticks while playing + visibility-change + beforeunload, dedupes in-flight POSTs). Sidebar tabs — `PlayerSidebar` hosts `AppTabs` + four inline body components (Sections / Notes / Bookmarks / Materials). Bookmarks tab `select(id)` emits `seek(time)` so the page seeks the video. Auto-advance: AppPlayerChrome `state="end"` with 5 s countdown → `navigateTo` next lesson; Stay-here clears, Play-next skips. Layouts: 1440 (1fr 360px), 1024 (1fr 280px), 360 (single column, tabs as horizontal scroller). Resume: `currentTime = lesson.progress.lastSeenAtSeconds` on `loadedmetadata`. Course detail Resume button retargeted from `/lessons/{id}` placeholder to `/courses/{id}/lessons/{lessonId}`.
- Side-effect fixes the e2e shook out: AppPlayerChrome `__overlay` z-index ordering (overlay was intercepting end-banner clicks); chromeState ordering (ended before stream error so stub data URIs show the banner); HTTP status capture via separate ref (useAsyncData strips custom Error properties).
- Notes / deferred: Real materials download endpoint deferred — clicks emit a "Download coming soon" toast (matches Course detail's pattern).

## T-2026-04-28-058 — Foundations canvas (E03-F01-S02)

- Created: 2026-04-28
- Completed: 2026-04-28
- Result: commit `a791ecd` on `feat/foundations-canvas` → PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/143 (Closes #12). 14 vitest + 2 Playwright snapshot tests pass; lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E03-F01-S02.md`
- Outcome: ships `/dev/foundations` — 17-section design-system canvas (Color / Typography / Spacing / Radius / Motion / Buttons / Inputs / Cards / Rows / Tabs+Segmented / Feedback / Overlays / Progress / Empty States / Skeleton / Avatar / Chips). Each section shows `@app/ui` components in their full variant × size × state matrix. `__tokens.vue` replaced with a redirect to `/dev/foundations` (backward-compat). `/dev/foundations` added to `PUBLIC_ROUTES` so visual-regression e2e runs without a token. Playwright full-page baselines at 1440×900 light + dark committed.
- Notes / deferred:
  - Mobile (`Tokens.theme.fromMode` + Widgetbook) deferred per user directive; noted in PR description.

## T-2026-04-27-053 — Home page Stage A · web + Playwright half (E14-F01-S01 part 2 of 2)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: two commits on `feat/web-home-page` (`75e0a7d` style + `65190ea` feat) → PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/138 (closes #59). 3/3 Playwright tests pass; web lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E14-F01-S01.md`
- Outcome: Stage A Home page composition lands on `apps/web/app/pages/index.vue`. Greeting (`AppAvatar` + role) + three `HomeRow`s (continue-watching, recently-added, recently-completed — collapsed by default) + right-rail `HomeYourWeek`. Two-column grid at viewport `> 1024px`, single column otherwise. Card sizing tuned so 1440 px shows ~5 `CourseWideCard`s and ~6 `CoursePosterCard`s per the card. Four states per row (loading skeleton, error + retry, empty, populated). `useHome.ts` exposes four `useAsyncData` composables wrapping the SDK; auth middleware now does a silent `auth.refresh()` on hard reload when a bearer token survived in localStorage but Pinia state is empty (production fix that also makes the e2e mocks round-trip without sign-in). Playwright e2e at three viewports (`1440x900`, `1024x768`, `375x800`) with `route()`-mocked endpoints — hermetic.
- Notes / deferred:
  - Bottom-tab nav at xs: `AppNavigationShell` already has the bar, but `default.vue` doesn't wrap children in the shell — migration deferred (cascades into auth/setup). E2e treats bottom-tab presence as conditional.
  - `instructor` rendered as empty string until the SDK home-item DTOs grow the field.
  - Card `accent` derived deterministically from `courseId` (small hash → fixed palette) since the SDK doesn't carry an accent column.

## T-2026-04-27-052 — Home page Stage A · spec + backend half (E14-F01-S01 part 1 of 2)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: two commits on `feat/web-home` (`e29298a` spec, `bb33650` backend) → PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/137 merged. Backend tests 696/698 (+30); lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E14-F01-S01.md`
- Outcome: three new bearer-auth endpoints — `GET /home/recently-added` (Course ordered by createdAt DESC + authz; bulk lesson stats via `Lesson.groupBy`), `GET /home/recently-completed` (CourseProgressReadModel rows where `lessonsCompleted == lessonsTotal AND lessonsTotal > 0`; Prisma can't express column-to-column equality so the adapter pulls `limit*3` rows and filters in-process), `GET /home/your-week` (`[now - 7d, now)` window; `minutesWatched = SUM(positionSeconds)/60` floored; `$queryRaw` for the conditional aggregate). Schemas: `RecentlyAddedDto`/`Item`, `RecentlyCompletedDto`/`Item`, `YourWeekDto` + new `DateRange`. Generated `@app/api-client-{ts,dart}` re-emitted. Catalog → Learning boundary preserved via the existing `src/common/learning-progress/` shared-kernel re-export. `HomeController` extracted a local `parseLimit` helper.

- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F02-S05.md` (source: `docs/design/cs-components/components.jsx` §NoteEditor, CSS `docs/design/cs-components/styles.css`)
- Outcome: `AppNoteEditor` — markdown note input with toolbar (Bold / Italic / Heading / List / Link), `edit` ↔ `view` toggle (v-modelable), debounced auto-save (`save(value)` after `debounceMs` of quiet, default 600), and an always-inline sync indicator (`syncing` / `saved` / `failed` / `offline`). The "Saved · Ns ago" label re-renders every second via a `setInterval` that auto-starts on `saved` and stops on every other state. `failed` exposes a Retry button that emits `retry`.
- Markdown renderer: in-house, no extra dep. Pipeline — HTML-escape raw input → inline links (URL routed through `safeUrl` which only allows http(s)/mailto, anything else → `#`) → `**bold**` (greedy first) → `*italic*` (with look-arounds) → block split on blank lines (h1/h2/h3 single-line, `- ` lists, paragraphs with `<br />`). `v-html` guarded with `/* eslint-disable vue/no-v-html */` and a WHY comment listing the sanitisation guarantees.
- A11y: toolbar `role="toolbar"`, every tool has `aria-label`, the toggle exposes `aria-pressed`, sync indicator is `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"`.
- Storybook: 7 stories (Default / Empty / Preview / Syncing / Failed / Offline / Interactive — last one wires `save` → `syncing` → `saved` with a 500 ms fake-network delay and prints the last event).

## T-2026-04-27-050 — Bookmark family (E13-F02-S04)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: single feature commit `6060a41` on `feat/bookmark-family` (closes #52) → PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/133. UI tests 786/786 (+23); lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F02-S04.md` (source: `docs/design/cs-components/components.jsx` §Bookmark / BookmarkAdd, CSS in `docs/design/cs-components/styles.css`)
- Outcome: three composable domain components for the lesson-player bookmark surface — no modal dialogs.
  - `AppBookmark` — `time, label?, editable?`. Mono accent time chip + label + hover-revealed Edit / Delete actions; click / Enter / Space → `select`; edit and delete `@click.stop` so row select does not bubble. Descriptive `aria-label`.
  - `AppBookmarkAdd` — `time, submitting?, placeholder?`. Inline add row (time chip + `AppInput` + Save). Enter saves, Escape cancels and clears the buffer, `submitting` disables input + blocks double-submit. Empty label allowed (matches JSX).
  - `AppBookmarkList` — `bookmarks, addTime?, editable?, adding?, emptyTitle?, emptyBody?`. Renders the add row when `addTime` is defined, then the bookmark stack, then `AppEmptyState` (icon `bookmark`) when both are absent. Forwards `select / edit / delete` with the entry id and `addSave / addCancel` from the add row.
- Storybook: 14 stories total (`AppBookmark`: Default / NoLabel / ReadOnly / Stack; `AppBookmarkAdd`: Default / Submitting / HourLong / Interactive; `AppBookmarkList`: Default / Empty / ReadOnly / WithAddRow / EmptyWithAddRow / Adding / Interactive).

## T-2026-04-27-049 — PlayerChrome web component (E13-F02-S03)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: single feature commit `9eb8c6a` on `feat/player-chrome` (closes #51) → PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/132. UI tests 763/763 (+31); lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F02-S03.md` (source: `docs/design/cs-components/components.jsx` §PlayerChrome, CSS in `docs/design/cs-components/styles.css`)
- Outcome: presentational lesson-player shell — no `<video>` yet (lands in E14-F03-S01). Two layout modes (`overlay` full chrome, `minimal` slim played-bar peek). Seven states (`idle`, `playing`, `paused`, `buffering`, `error`, `end`, `locked`); `error` and `locked` make the chrome inert (`tabindex=-1`, play disabled, keyboard + scrubber no-op). Scrubber renders track / buffered / played / thumb + optional chapter ticks + bookmark markers (clicking a marker emits `seek` to that time). Slider exposes `role="slider"`, `aria-valuemin=0`, `aria-valuemax=duration`, `aria-valuenow=position`, `aria-valuetext="<current> of <total>"`. Buffer spinner respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Emits: card-mandated `play, pause, seek, speed, toggleSubtitles, togglePip, toggleFullscreen, nextLesson` plus organic `toggleMute, retry, stayHere, prevLesson`.
- Keyboard map: Space/K (play-pause), ←/→ (±5s), J/L (±10s), `,`/`.` (±1/24s), F (fullscreen), M (mute), 0–9 (jump n × 10 %). All seeks clamp to [0, duration]; inputs/textareas inside the chrome are skipped.
- Storybook: 11 stories (each state + Minimal / Muted / NoChaptersOrBookmarks + an `Interactive` sandbox that wires every emit to local refs and prints the last event).

## T-2026-04-27-048 — LessonRow + SectionHeader (E13-F02-S02)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: single feature commit `c30dd40` on `feat/lesson-row` (closes #50) → PR http://code.homelab.local/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pulls/128. UI tests 732/732 (+19); lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F02-S02.md` (source: `docs/design/cs-components/components.jsx` §LessonRow + SectionHeader, CSS in `docs/design/cs-components/styles.css`)
- Outcome: two domain components for the course detail outline.
  - `AppLessonRow` — `num, title, duration, state, materials?, current?, progress?, loading?`. State matrix: `not-started` (circle), `in-progress` (circle + thin underline + `<n>% watched`), `completed` (check-circle / success), `locked` (lock / muted / inert with `aria-disabled` + `tabindex=-1`). `current=true` is orthogonal to state — flips icon to `play`, paints soft-accent background, draws 3px leading bar, sets `aria-current="true"`. Trailing: optional PDF icon when `materials=true`, mono-spaced duration (`H:MM:SS` ≥ 1h, else `M:SS`). Loading variant renders four `AppSkeleton` strips matching the row layout. Activation: click + Enter/Space emit `select`; locked/loading rows are inert.
  - `AppSectionHeader` — `idx, title, count, duration, open?` (default `open: true`). Title `Section <pad2(idx)> · <title>`; meta `<count> lesson(s) · <Xh Ym | Xh | Ym>` mono-spaced. Chevron rotates `-90deg` when `open=false`. Click + Enter/Space emit `toggle`; `aria-expanded` mirrors `open`.
- Notes: mobile-only `downloadState` from the JSX bundle deferred to a future Flutter card. `fmtTime` is inlined per-component to avoid coupling AppLessonRow to CourseCard.

## T-2026-04-27-047 — AppSsoBlock — SSO/OAuth provider button row (E13-F02-S10)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: single feature commit `203f461` on `feat/sso-block` (closes #58). UI tests 713/713 (+6); lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F02-S10.md` (source: `docs/design/shared/auth.jsx` §SsoBlock)
- Outcome: `AppSsoBlock` ships a vertical stack of secondary `AppButton`s (one per provider) with leading icons. Empty `providers` array renders nothing so the auth page can skip its surrounding "or" divider via the same `providers.length` check. Provider list is fully configurable per the card — any `{ id, label, iconName }` triple works. Click on a button emits `select` with the provider id; the consumer dispatches the right Better Auth flow.
- Architecture: thin wrapper around `AppButton` (variant `secondary`, `block: true`). Wrapper carries `role="group"` + `aria-label="Sign in with"` for screen readers.
- v1 scope: PRD puts OAuth/OIDC/SAML at v2+. The component is in place; the populating data comes from a future `GET /admin/instance` once Better Auth's `genericOAuth` plugins land.

## T-2026-04-27-045 — CourseCard family (poster / wide / compact) (E13-F02-S01)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: 5 feature commits on `feat/course-card` — `6f72324` (types + helpers + composable), `562f918` (CoursePosterCard), `675aebb` (CourseWideCard), `f85ace6` (CourseCompactRow), `f2a9969` (barrel + Family story). UI tests 662/662 (+71); lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F02-S01.md` (source: `docs/design/cs-components/components.jsx` §CourseCard)
- Outcome: three CourseCard variants share `Course` type + `COVER` accent map + `initials()` / `fmtTime()` helpers + `useCourseProgress(course, state)` composable. **Poster** (3:4 cover, ✓ badge for completed, lock + scrim for locked, otherwise progress strip; body with title + instructor). **Wide** (square 80×80 thumb + body with title/instructor/meta row; meta shows `Resume <fmtTime>` (with play icon) or `<pct>%` then `<completed>/<lessons>`). **Compact** (single-line list row: 32×32 thumb + title + bar + mono pct). All three are focusable buttons (`tabindex=0`, `role=button`, `aria-label=title`) with click + Enter/Space activation. Loading variants render skeletons matching the layout.
- Composable: `useCourseProgress(course, state)` accepts `ComputedRef<T> | (() => T)` for both args; returns `{ pct, realState }`. `state="auto"` derives `realState` from `pct` (100 → completed, >0 → in-progress, else not-started); explicit states pass through. 18 dedicated unit tests for the derivation table.
- Storybook: per-variant stories cover Default / NotStarted / InProgress / Completed / Locked / Loading / Variants (all 6 accents) plus a top-level `CourseCardFamily` story rendering all three side by side and a `FamilyAllAccents` story for COVER spot-checking.
- Deviations: composable file is `use-course-progress.ts` (kebab-case per project `unicorn/filename-case`). `CoursePosterCard` loading uses an `aspect-ratio: 3/4` SCSS class on top of `AppSkeleton` because the latter doesn't accept `aspect-ratio` as a prop. `course.cover` override test uses `toContain('url(')` since Vue normalises inline `url()` style values.

## T-2026-04-27-044 — AppPasswordField — visibility toggle + strength meter (E13-F02-S09)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: single feature commit `1c1b015` on `feat/password-field`. UI tests 591/591 (+18); lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F02-S09.md` (source: `docs/design/shared/auth.jsx` §PasswordField)
- Outcome: `AppPasswordField` ships a labelled password input with a leading lock icon, a raw `<button>` visibility toggle on the right (aria-pressed + dynamic aria-label), and an optional 3-segment strength meter. Score heuristic copied verbatim from the JSX (empty/<8/<12/≥12-with-symbol-or->16). Three meter colours track the score (error/warning/success). `error` / `hint` / `meter-label` collapse via `v-else-if` so only one footer line ever renders; `error` wins.
- Toggle uses a plain `<button>` rather than `AppIconButton` so `aria-pressed` and `aria-label` are native HTML attrs without prop-typing gymnastics. Custom CSS matches the bundle's `btn btn-ghost btn-icon btn-sm` look.
- Tokens: `--brand-accent` (focus ring), `--surface-overlay` (meter track + toggle hover), `--status-{error,warning,success}-fg` (meter fill per score), `--text-secondary` (muted text/icon), `--surface-bg-muted` (disabled background).

## T-2026-04-27-043 — AppProgressBadge — ring/bar/pill variants (E13-F02-S06)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: single feature commit `9c37d9b` on `feat/progress-badge`. UI tests 573/573 (+21); lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F02-S06.md` (source: `docs/design/cs-components/components.jsx` §ProgressBadge)
- Outcome: new `AppProgressBadge` covering three visual variants (`ring` 32px conic-gradient, `bar` 4px filled with mono pct, `pill` text matrix) and four domain states (`not-started | in-progress | completed | locked`). Percentage compute: `completed` → 100, `locked`/`not-started` → 0, otherwise `round((completed / total) × 100)` with `total ≤ 0` guard. Drives only off shipped tokens (no hard-coded colors). Storybook ships a 3×4 Variants matrix.
- Architectural notes: multi-root SFC (one branch per variant via `v-if/v-else-if/v-else`) — tests query `.find('.app-progress-badge')` for root-level attributes since `wrapper.attributes()` doesn't traverse multi-root fragments reliably.

## T-2026-04-27-042 — Auth setup wizard + sign-in flow (E11-F01-S03)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: 6 commits on `feat/auth-setup-wizard` — `08b2570` (`/admin/has-users` probe + port + adapter), `d1b977a` (Better Auth admin-promotion hook), `78d8117` (`useAuthStore.signUp`), `2a55ea1` (rename `/login` → `/sign-in`), `6e6bfc7` (`/setup` page + `hasUsers` middleware gate). Backend tests 668/668 (+4); web tests 19/19 (+2); lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E11-F01-S03.md`
- Outcome: minimal-but-functional first-run flow. Backend exposes `GET /api/v1/admin/has-users` (anonymous, sibling controller to keep `AdminController`'s class-level `AdminGuard` intact); Better Auth `databaseHooks.user.create.before` promotes the first user to `role: 'ADMIN'`. SPA: `useAuthStore.signUp` mirrors the existing `signIn` `set-auth-token` capture; `pages/setup.vue` collects email + password + optional display name and submits via the store; middleware gates `/setup` / `/sign-in` based on a per-session `hasUsers` cache; `pages/login.vue` renamed to `pages/sign-in.vue` with all references and locale keys updated.
- Architectural calls: `AdminPublicController` is a separate class because `@AllowAnonymous()` only opts out of the global `SessionGuard`, not the existing `AdminController`'s class-level `AdminGuard`. The `hasUsers` cache lives in `app/composables/useHasUsersCache.ts` (ref + `resetHasUsersCache()` helper) so the middleware keeps its single-default-export contract.

## T-2026-04-27-041 — Primitives batch B: dialog + avatar + chip refactor (E13-F01-S08/S11/S12)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: 4 feature commits on `feat/primitives-batch-b` — `ac5e3e4` (AppDialog), `3b2dc4b` (AppCommandPalette), `cf8830b` (AppAvatar), `659c626` (AppChip refactor + barrel). UI tests 552/552 (+39 net); lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F01-S08.md`, `E13-F01-S11.md`, `E13-F01-S12.md`
- Outcome: 4 components landed. **AppDialog** uses native `<dialog>.showModal()` so focus trap + `inert` are browser-native; backdrop click detection via `event.target === dialogRef`; ESC + close event wired to `update:open`. **AppCommandPalette** composes AppDialog with a search input + filtered/grouped list, arrow-key nav, Enter to select, ESC to close; `Command` type exported alongside. **AppAvatar** has 5 sizes + `image`/`initials`/`name` (computed fallback) + role badges for admin/guest with `aria-label`. **AppChip** refactored from `color × variant × size` to flat `variant: 'default'|'primary'|'success'|'warning'|'error'|'info'` matching the bundle's `.chip-*` classes; icon migrated from AppIcon (Iconify) to IconCS (typed `IconName`); `dismissible` renamed to `removable` to match `.chip-removable`; broken `--status-danger` reference fixed.
- JSDOM workaround: `<dialog>` not fully implemented in JSDOM. AppDialog.spec.ts patches `HTMLElement.prototype.showModal/close` with no-op functions that toggle `open` and dispatch the `close` event in `beforeAll`/`afterAll`; a `stubDialogElement(el)` utility provides per-test `vi.fn()` spies. Documented inline.
- Token deviations: `--bg` → `--surface-page` (not `--surface-bg` as previously assumed). All other mappings inherited from prior tasks.

## T-2026-04-27-040 — Primitives batch A (E13-F01-S05/S06/S09/S10)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: 5 feature commits on `feat/primitives-batch-a` — `04e1533` (AppRow), `89cb69a` (AppTabs + AppTab), `c5c3bff` (AppSegmented + AppSegmentedItem), `6abee87` (Progress + Spinner + Skeleton), `d8b9d58` (3 state surfaces + barrel). UI tests 513/513 (+103); lint + typecheck + stylelint clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F01-S05.md`, `E13-F01-S06.md`, `E13-F01-S09.md`, `E13-F01-S10.md` — 4 cards flipped together.
- Outcome: 12 new exports from `@app/ui` covering 10 components — `AppRow`, `AppTabs`, `AppTab`, `AppSegmented`, `AppSegmentedItem`, `AppProgressLinear`, `AppProgressCircle`, `AppSpinner`, `AppSkeleton`, `AppEmptyState`, `AppErrorState`, `AppNoPermission`. All driven off shipped tokens (some bundle aliases ship verbatim, e.g. `--text-loud`, `--surface-2`, `--shadow-1` — engineer used the canonical alias chain). AppTabs and AppSegmented are generic over `T extends string | number` with provide/inject context to children. AppSpinner is a reusable component; AppButton/AppIconButton's inline `::after` spinner is intentionally left as-is (interaction-bound, no a11y cost).
- Architectural calls: arrow-key nav in AppTabs uses DOM-sibling traversal (matches the WCAG tablist pattern from AppRadioGroup in T-037). Generic SFC + vue-test-utils requires `wrapper.vm as { active: T }` workaround for typed access. State surfaces (Empty/Error/NoPermission) ship as three near-duplicate templates rather than an `AppStateBase` abstraction — easier to read and unlikely to drift.
- Token mapping discoveries: `--text-loud` ships verbatim (separate from `--text-fg`); `--text-muted` → `--text-secondary` (not `--text-fg-muted` as previous components used); `--shadow-1` → `--shadow-xs`; `--surface-3` → `--surface-overlay`. Documented inline in the SCSS.

## T-2026-04-27-039 — AppBanner / AppToast / AppAlert (E13-F01-S07)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: three feature commits on `feat/banners-alerts` — `8f4b996` (AppBanner), `65790c4` (AppToast), `7b24087` (AppAlert + barrel). UI tests 410/410 (+54); lint + typecheck + stylelint clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F01-S07.md`
- Outcome: three notification-surface components covering the bundle CSS contract. `AppBanner` (4 variants, optional title, dismissible) uses `IconCS` for the leading glyph (info / check-circle / alert) and `AppIconButton` for the dismiss control. `AppToast` is the compact transient surface with the colored 8px dot indicator (success/info/error). `AppAlert` is the single-line inline variant for under-the-input validation messages. All three drive only off shipped status tokens (`--success`, `--success-soft`, etc.); no token-name deviations needed.
- A11y: error variants use `role="alert"` (assertive); other variants use `role="status"` (polite). `AppAlert` is always `role="alert"`. Dismiss buttons carry `aria-label` (overridable, defaults to "Dismiss").
- Out of scope: toast queue/container with auto-dismiss timing — left for a future story (E13-F01-S08 deals with dialogs which include some toast-adjacent behaviour).

## T-2026-04-27-038 — AppCard size + hoverable (E13-F01-S04)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: commit `6f0f481` on `feat/app-card-bundle` (+ a prettier sweep `e7cdbf3`). UI tests 356/356 (+4); lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F01-S04.md`
- Outcome: AppCard gained `size: 'md' | 'lg'` (matches bundle `.card` and `.card-lg`) and `hoverable: boolean` (matches `.card-hover`). Default size is `md` with `--radius-md` + 16px uniform padding; `lg` is `--radius-lg` + 24px. `hoverable` shifts border to `--border-strong` and background to `--surface-raised` on hover, stays a `<div>`, no focus ring; ignored when `interactive` is also true. Existing `interactive` button mode preserved.

## T-2026-04-27-037 — Form primitives (E13-F01-S03)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: four feature commits on `feat/form-primitives` — `e28d7ec` (audit/fix existing controls), `c8d232d` (AppCheckbox), `3aee420` (AppRadio + AppRadioGroup), `9136d42` (text/number/search field composites + barrel). UI tests 352/352 (+80); web tests 17/17; lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F01-S03.md`
- Outcome: full 7-component form set landed. `AppCheckbox` with indeterminate + Space/Enter keyboard support. `AppRadio` + `AppRadioGroup` with WCAG-pattern arrow-key navigation (only checked radio is `tabindex=0`). Composite `AppTextField` / `AppNumberField` / `AppSearchField` wrap `AppField` + `AppInput` with the right type/icons (`+`/`−` steppers using `AppIconButton`; leading `IconCS search` + trailing clear button on search). Existing `AppInput` heights pinned to `28/36/44 px` (replacing broken `var(--space-20)`); `[data-density='compact']` drops md to 30 px per the bundle CSS contract. `AppField` error token corrected (`--status-danger` → `--status-error-fg`). `AppSwitch` `$attrs` propagation fixed so AppField's `id`/`aria-*` land on `<button role='switch'>` not the wrapping `<label>`.
- Architectural calls: arrow-key nav uses DOM traversal (`querySelectorAll('[role=radio]')`) rather than a ref-array registration pattern — matches WCAG radiogroup. ESLint `vue/attribute-hyphenation` ignores `ariaLabel` so AppIconButton's camelCase prop name reconciles with vue-tsc's static type checks (scoped to packages/ui).

## T-2026-04-27-036 — AppButton + AppIconButton (E13-F01-S02)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: three commits on `feat/app-button-icon` — `0e64fe3` (AppButton refactor), `615cfd6` (AppIconButton), `104ca10` (login.vue migration). UI tests 272/272; web tests 17/17; lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F01-S02.md`
- Outcome: `AppButton` collapsed to a flat 4-variant API (`primary | secondary | ghost | destructive`) matching the bundle's `.btn-*` CSS contract; loading state surfaces as `data-loading="true"` with the spinner painted via `::after`; icons typed as `IconName` literals from E13-F01-S01. New `AppIconButton` square component (28/36/44 width === height) wraps `IconCS` and requires `aria-label` (TypeScript-enforced). Storybook covers all 6 states (Default/Hover/Active/Focus/Disabled/Loading) plus a 4×3 Variants matrix for both components. `apps/web/app/pages/login.vue` migrated to the new prop shape.
- Deviations: (1) Three token names from the brief didn't exist in `tokens.generated.css` — substituted: `--surface-surface-alt` → `--surface-raised`, `--status-danger` → `--status-error-fg`, `--text-fg-inverse` → `--text-inverse`. Documented inline in the SCSS. (2) `AppIcon` kept (still used by `AppChip` + `AppBadge`); future cleanup story can migrate those to `IconCS`.
- Tests: +15 (12 new in `AppIconButton.spec.ts` + 3 new cases in updated `AppButton.spec.ts`).

## T-2026-04-27-035 — IconCS — port the bundle's 61-icon family to Vue (E13-F01-S01)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: three commits on `feat/icon-cs` — `42e8aab` (component + types + barrel), `493dfb4` (66 snapshot tests + 4 a11y/fill assertions), `9617ade` (Storybook stories). UI tests +70; lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E13-F01-S01.md`
- Outcome: new `IconCS` component in `packages/ui/src/components/IconCS/` renders any of 66 hand-drawn CourseShelf glyphs from `docs/design/shared/icons.jsx`. Single Vue `<svg>` template with `<template v-if="name === '...'>` per glyph; path data byte-identical to the JSX source (including the `pdf` glyph's `<text>` element). `IconName` literal union exported alongside. Storybook stories: default (single icon) + Grid (all 66 in an 8-column layout). Vitest snapshot per glyph (66) + 4 a11y/fill assertions.
- Deviations: (1) the card's Notes section listed 61 names but the source ships 66 — `sliders`, `arrow-left`, `more-h`, `corner-down-right`, `hard-drive` were extra. All included; the card's "61 names compile" NFR is a strict subset. (2) BEM class is `.app-icon-cs` (not `.icon-cs`) to satisfy the project Stylelint `selector-class-pattern` rule. (3) ESLint filename-case override added for `IconCS/` — the all-caps `CS` acronym doesn't fit kebab-case or strict PascalCase. (4) The `fill` prop honours only `play` and `bookmark` (per the JSX `fill={fill ? stroke : 'none'}` source pattern); other glyphs with intentional inner fills (`pip`, `list`, `more`, etc.) carry `fill="currentColor"` unconditionally as in the source.

## T-2026-04-27-034 — Wire api-client-ts + auth store (E11-F01-S02)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: six commits on `feat/web-auth-store` — `07374de` (Pinia install), `72e11c4` (auth store), `0780768` (api.client plugin), `2155d9e` (global middleware), `f247814` (login + layout migration + delete legacy composables), `b3647cf` (task-card flip). Web tests 17/17 (6 token-page + 11 auth-store); lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E11-F01-S02.md`
- Outcome: bearer-auth-end-to-end on the Nuxt SPA. New Pinia `useAuthStore` wraps `better-auth/vue` and captures the bearer token via a `set-auth-token` response-header hook on sign-in. New `plugins/api.client.ts` Nuxt SPA plugin configures the singleton `client` from `@app/api-client-ts`: request interceptor adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when present; response interceptor on 401 calls `auth.refresh()` once then redirects to `/login` if refresh fails. New `middleware/auth.global.ts` gates every route except `/login`, `/signup`, `/__tokens`. `pages/login.vue` and `layouts/default.vue` migrated to the store; `composables/useApi.ts`, `useAuth.ts`, `useApiShape.ts` deleted.
- Deviations: (1) `bearerClient()` plugin not present in `better-auth@1.6.8` — token captured via `@better-fetch/fetch` `onSuccess` hook reading `set-auth-token` instead. (2) Redirect target is `/login` (codebase route) rather than `/sign-in` (card text). (3) `plugins/api.client.spec.ts` deferred — Nuxt-runtime-context faking is awkward; 11 store tests cover the substance. (4) `useApiShape.ts` had zero callers; deleted with the other composables. (5) `@app/api-client-ts/src/index.ts` (hand-written entry) gained a `client` re-export — no codegen rule violated.

## T-2026-04-27-033 — Web SPA bootstrap closeout (E11-F01-S01)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: two commits on `feat/web-tokens-page` — `ff0f21c` (dark default), `4f09056` (tokens canvas + test). Tests 6/6; lint 0 errors; typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E11-F01-S01.md`
- Outcome: `nuxt.config.ts` gains `colorMode: { preference: 'dark', fallback: 'dark' }`. New `pages/__tokens.vue` renders all five token categories (color × 5 sub-groups with `getComputedStyle` live values, spacing bars, radius chips, typography specimens, motion/opacity raw `<dl>`). `UColorModeButton` in the header flips themes in one click. Six vitest assertions cover every category. Also added `@vitejs/plugin-vue` dev dep + `vitest.nuxt-imports-shim.ts` so `#imports` resolves in the plain vitest environment.
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] T-033-A: dark default + colorMode block in `nuxt.config.ts`
  - [x] T-033-B: `pages/__tokens.vue` foundations canvas
  - [x] T-033-C: component test for the page
  - [x] T-033-D: lint, typecheck, test, prettier; flip card; archive T-033

## T-2026-04-27-032 — Admin dashboard aggregator (E21-F01-S01)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: three commits on `feat/admin-dashboard` — `a89fc9c` (spec), `1b3972d` (codegen), `d9bbe11` (impl). Backend tests 664/664; lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E21-F01-S01.md` (PRD FR-OPS-02)
- Outcome: new `AdminModule` ships `GET /api/v1/admin/dashboard` returning `AdminDashboardDto { generatedAt, counts: { libraries, users, courses, lessons }, latestScan, errorsLast24h }`. Six counts run in parallel via `Promise.all`. Auth chain: global `SessionGuard` → class-level `@UseGuards(AdminGuard)`. Future `/admin/*` routes inherit AdminGuard automatically.
- Architecture deviation (improvement): rather than injecting `PrismaService` directly into the application handler (which would trip the `no-restricted-syntax` lint rule banning Prisma in `application/**`), the work was structured as `domain/dashboard.port.ts` (interface + Symbol token) + `infra/prisma-dashboard.adapter.ts` (Prisma implementation). Tighter DDD layering than the brief specified.
- `errorsLast24h` uses `Scan.startedAt > now - 24h` as a proxy timestamp because `ScanErrorRecord` has no own timestamp. The OpenAPI description documents this approximation; works because no scan is expected to outlive a 24-hour window.
- Tests: `get-admin-dashboard.handler.spec.ts` — 4 cases (populated snapshot, null latestScan when no scans, finishedAt null while running, generatedAt is stamped). The 24h cutoff window check moved to adapter responsibility.

## T-2026-04-27-031 — Rate limit on Better Auth sign-in (E21-F02-S01)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: single impl commit `5116d9c` on `feat/auth-signin-ratelimit`. Backend tests 660/660; lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E21-F02-S01.md` (PRD NFR-S-03)
- Outcome: new `SignInRateLimitMiddleware` (in-process token bucket keyed by `req.ip`, 5 attempts / 15 min rolling window) mounted on `POST /api/v1/auth/sign-in/*splat` via `AuthModule.configure`. 6th attempt → `429 Too Many Requests` + `Retry-After: <seconds>` header + RFC 9457 problem JSON. Successful sign-ins also count toward the cap (a successful brute-force probe is still a probe). Other Better Auth routes keep the existing 10/60s class-level `@Throttle` floor.
- Tests: 5 cases — under cap allows, at-cap blocks 429, IPs counted independently, window expires (fake timers), Retry-After value tracks the oldest in-window attempt.
- Trade-off: in-process Map state assumes single backend instance. Redis-backed store is deliberately deferred per the card's sub-step note. When we move to multi-instance, the swap is mechanical.

## T-2026-04-27-030 — E02 retroactive flips (E02-F01-S01, E02-F02-S01, E02-F02-S02, E02-F02-S04)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: roadmap-only commit on `chore/e02-flips`. No code changes.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E02-F01-S01.md`, `E02-F02-S01.md`, `E02-F02-S02.md`, `E02-F02-S04.md`
- Outcome: ticked four cards that had been load-bearing for the entire session (every endpoint shipped this week passed through the spec workspace, the codegen pipeline, and — in CI — the contract test). Each card carries a deviation note documenting why reality looks different from what the card asked for:
  - **E02-F01-S01**: Redocly CLI instead of Spectral; single inline `openapi.yaml` instead of split `paths/*` + `components/*` files.
  - **E02-F02-S01**: `@hey-api/openapi-ts` (named operation functions) instead of `openapi-fetch`-style `paths`/`components`/`createClient`.
  - **E02-F02-S02**: `@app/api-client-ts/server` subpath with class-validator DTOs **not** implemented; runtime validation is delivered by the `express-openapi-validator` middleware (E04-F02-S03) at the HTTP boundary, with backend handlers using type-only imports from `@app/api-client-ts`. Same guarantee from a single source of truth.
  - **E02-F02-S04**: contract testing uses Schemathesis (Docker, property-based, ~25 hypothesis-generated requests per operation) instead of Dredd/Prism. No `apps/backend/test/contract/` directory — the runner sits in `packages/specs/scripts/contract-test.ts` and exercises a running backend over the wire as a black box.
- Out of scope: actually implementing the deviated alternatives is not planned — the substitutes are deliberate architectural choices, not gaps to close.

## T-2026-04-27-029 — Realtime token + channels (E24-F01-S01)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: three commits on `feat/realtime-channels` — `f1e30d2` (AsyncAPI), `9007b95` (backend), `fd2905d` (Centrifugo namespaces). Backend tests 655/655; lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E24-F01-S01.md`
- Outcome: AsyncAPI grew from one channel to four — `system:health` (existing) + `library:scan:{libraryId}`, `notes:lesson:{lessonId}`, `progress:user:{userId}` with full schemas + receive operations. The `RealtimeService` JWT now carries a `channels: string[]` claim restricting subscribe scope to the user-scoped triple `['system:health', 'progress:user:<id>', 'notifications:user:<id>']`. The controller was refactored from the pre-E04-alignment `@Req()` + `auth.getSession(req)` plumbing to `@Session() session: SessionContext` + `@Throttle({ default: { limit: 30, ttl: 60_000 } })`. Centrifugo namespace config (`docker/centrifugo/config.json`) declares the four new namespaces with presence off + history off (safe defaults; future stories can tune per channel).
- Tests: `realtime.service.spec.ts` — 6 cases (sub matches user.id, exp ≈ now+ttl with fake timers, channels membership + length, expiresAt epoch matches exp, valid-secret verify, wrong-secret rejects).
- Deviation: the wildcard channels (`notes:lesson:*`, `library:scan:*`) are not in the connection token's `channels` claim — they need subscribe-time per-channel auth via Centrifugo's `subscribe_proxy`, which is a future story. Also: AsyncAPI 3 / Draft-7 doesn't support OpenAPI's `discriminator`, so the `ScanEvent` oneOf uses per-variant `kind` enums instead.
- Out of scope: actually publishing events into the new channels (the `CentrifugoService.publish` plumbing exists but is unused — feature stories that own the events will wire calls to it).

## T-2026-04-27-028 — E04 alignment (E04-F01-S01..E04-F02-S03)

- Created: 2026-04-27
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: 7 commits on `feat/e04-alignment` (`33cedf6`, `f455d78`, `501bcc2`, `10dd112`, `66d411d`, `e386476`, `50a863e`). Backend tests 649/649; lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E04-F01-S01.md`, `E04-F01-S02.md`, `E04-F02-S01.md`, `E04-F02-S02.md`, `E04-F02-S03.md`.
- Outcome: closed the deltas between the actually-shipped backend (which was built on top of an E04 base while those cards were still open) and the cards' acceptance sets, so all five could be flipped to ✅ Done with truthful sub-step ticks instead of "deviation: …" notes. Concrete changes:
  - **`@AllowAnonymous()` + `@Session()` decorators**, **global `SessionGuard`** registered via `APP_GUARD`, and refactor of 9 controllers (Catalog × 4, Learning × 3, Streaming × 1, Auth catch-all × 1) — `@UseGuards(SessionGuard)` + private `resolveActor(req)` boilerplate replaced by `@Session() session: SessionContext`. `_template/_template.controller.ts` deliberately preserved as a counter-example.
  - **`OpsModule`** with `GET /healthz` (always 200) and `GET /readyz` (Prisma `SELECT 1`, returns 503 on failure). Both routes excluded from `setGlobalPrefix('api', { exclude })` so they sit at the server root, outside the `/api` validator mount, and outside the OpenAPI spec.
  - **Better Auth** `admin` plugin enabled; `additionalFields { role: 'string' default 'USER', displayName: 'string' optional }`; `pnpm auth:schema` script regenerates the auth Prisma section.
  - **`GET /api/v1/ping`** authenticated smoke-test endpoint — spec, codegen, `PingController` using the new `@Session()` decorator.
  - Explicit **`ignorePaths`** in the OpenAPI validator: `^\/v1\/auth(\/|$)` (Better Auth handles its own request shapes).
- Deviations from cards:
  - `@thallesp/nestjs-better-auth` **not** installed (native integration is solid; risk-reward poor for a third-party Nest wrapper).
  - Better Auth lives in `apps/backend/src/common/auth/` (not `apps/backend/src/identity/auth.ts`).
  - The domain-error → HTTP filter is named `HttpExceptionFilter` (the cards' `DomainErrorFilter` is the same thing).
  - Existing `phoneNumber` plugin and richer `GET /api/v1/health` snapshot are preserved on top of the cards' minimum.

## T-2026-04-26-027 — Batch progress endpoint for sync (E09-F01-S02)

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: three commits on `feat/progress-batch` — `ff99972` (spec), `e47802a` (codegen), `ac95b71` (impl). Backend tests 638/638; lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E09-F01-S02.md`
- Outcome: new `POST /api/v1/progress/batch` accepts up to 200 items per round-trip, returns per-item status (`accepted` | `stale` | `forbidden`) in input order. `RecordProgressBatchHandler` fans out to the existing `RecordProgressCommand` via the command bus — sequential, no parallelism (bounded fan-out, keeps Prisma writes serial, avoids re-entering the same `(userId, lessonId)` row in duplicate-item edge cases). `stale` is computed by strict comparison (`serverLastSeenAt > clientUpdatedAt`); equal timestamps classify as `accepted`. `PermissionDenied` thrown by the inner handler maps to per-item `forbidden` (no-oracle covers missing lessons too); non-permission errors bubble.
- Tests: `record-progress-batch.handler.spec.ts` — 5 cases (mixed three-outcome batch, equal-timestamp accepted, non-permission error bubbles, empty array, sequential call order verified via `mock.calls`).
- Spec deviation from card: card mentioned a `not-found` status; the implementation collapses it into `forbidden` per the no-oracle rule used elsewhere in Learning. Documented in the OpenAPI description.

## T-2026-04-26-026 — ffprobe + thumbnail extraction (E06-F02-S02)

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-27
- Result: single impl commit `4368123` on `feat/ffprobe-thumbnails`. Backend tests 631/631; lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Spec: `docs/roadmap/tasks/E06-F02-S02.md`
- Outcome: new domain port `FfmpegAdapter` + `LocalFfmpegAdapter` shelling out to `ffprobe` / `ffmpeg` via `child_process.execFile` (deviation from card — skipped `fluent-ffmpeg` to avoid extra dep + types fight). `AppConfig.ffprobePath`, `AppConfig.ffmpegPath`, `AppConfig.thumbnailJpegQuality` configurable. Scan handler probes each video and writes a 320×180 JPEG poster (`<src>.thumb.jpg` next to the video). Failure on a single file records `ffmpeg-probe-failed` / `ffmpeg-thumbnail-failed` ScanError and the walk continues. Thumbnail generation is idempotent on mtime. `*.thumb.jpg` is now classified as `ignored` in stem-match so generated thumbs do not round-trip into `Lesson.materials`. Lesson row insertion remains deferred to a future "scan-materialise" story — this card only populates `Scan.discoveredLessons[].metadata` and the on-disk JPEG.
- Tests: adapter unit (5 cases, mocks `execFile` + ffprobe JSON parsing), adapter integration (skipped when no `ffmpeg` in PATH), `run-scan.handler.spec.ts` regression (two-video fixture with one probe rejection), `stem-match.spec.ts` regression (`.thumb.jpg` → `ignored`).
- Docs: `docs/troubleshooting.md` ffmpeg/ffprobe prerequisite entry.

## T-2026-04-26-019 — Short-lived signed stream tokens (E08-F01-S01)

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: three commits on `feat/stream-tokens`: `cf645ae` (spec), `b0486ae` (codegen), `55fd5b4` (impl). Backend tests 375/375; lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Goal: `GET /api/v1/lessons/{id}/stream-url` mints an opaque HMAC-signed token bound to `(userId, lessonId, expiresAt)`; verify in O(1) with no DB lookup.
- Spec diff: `packages/specs/openapi/openapi.yaml` — `GET /lessons/{id}/stream-url` + `StreamUrlDto`. New top-level `Streaming` tag. Spec version 0.6.0 → 0.7.0.
- Codegen impact: yes — TS + Dart regenerated.
- Design impact: none.
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] OpenAPI: `issueStreamUrl` + `StreamUrlDto`
  - [x] TS + Dart codegen
  - [x] new module `apps/backend/src/modules/streaming/`; `StreamingController` registered in `app.module.ts`

  - [x] errors — `StreamTokenInvalidError` base + Tampered / Expired / LessonMismatch / Malformed subclasses
  - [x] `IssueStreamTokenQuery` + handler — lesson load → parent-course walk → `AuthorizationService.canSee` → sign
  - [x] `AppConfig` extended with `streamTokenTtlSeconds` (default 900) and `streamTokenHkdfInfo` (default `"courseshelf:stream-token:v1"`)
  - [x] cross-module wiring via `apps/backend/src/common/catalog-tokens/` — re-exports `LESSON_REPOSITORY` / `COURSE_REPOSITORY` / `LessonNotFoundError` plus `CatalogRepositoriesModule` that binds the Prisma adapters; boundaries-config compliant
  - [x] 20+ new tests (signer round-trip + tamper + expiry + mismatch + malformed; handler admin / non-admin / missing-parent paths)

## T-2026-04-26-018 — Lesson + Material + Subtitle read model (E06-F03-S02)

- Owner: claude
- Goal: `GET /api/v1/lessons/{id}` returns lesson metadata + sidecar materials and subtitles (language guessed from filename suffix); raw paths never leak in the DTO (NFR-S-01).
- Spec diff: `packages/specs/openapi/openapi.yaml` — `GET /lessons/{id}` + `LessonDto` / `MaterialDto` / `MaterialKind` / `SubtitleDto` / `LessonProgress`. Spec version 0.5.0 → 0.6.0.

## T-2026-04-26-016 — extend scan parser: composite ordinals + word-prefixed sections

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: single commit on `feat/scan-parser-extended` — `901aa83`. Backend tests 200/200; lint + typecheck clean.
- Owner: claude
- Goal: every realistic Russian / Udemy-style course folder layout in `docs/data/courses/` is recognised with clean section/lesson labels and correct ordinals.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: none
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] tier-3 `COMPOSITE_LESSON_RE` for `N.M Title` and `N.M` lessons (`2.5 Установка…` → `sectionOrdinal=2, ordinal=5, label="Установка на Windows"`)
  - [x] tier-2 `WORD_PREFIXED_RE` (`\p{L}+ N - Title`) for Russian / English module folders (`Модуль 2 - Настройки окружения` → `ordinal=2, label="Настройки окружения"`)
  - [x] `RunScanHandler` runs `parseFolderName` on section folders so `sectionTitles` are clean labels
  - [x] +9 spec cases covering composite + word-prefixed forms; existing 191 tests still green
  - [x] sample `course.json` for `videosmile - Super Figma` (gitignored — manual-verification helper for lessons whose file names are just `N.M.mp4` with no inline title)

## T-2026-04-26-015 — Scan aggregate, FsAdapter, incremental scan (E06-F02-S01)

- Created: 2026-04-25
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: single commit on `feat/library-scan`. Scan aggregate + FsAdapter port + NodeFsAdapter + incremental (mtime,size) detection + course.json v1 parser + folder-name parser + RunScanHandler (fire-and-forget walk) + GetLatestScanHandler + ScansController + PrismaScanRepository + migration. 191 tests green; lint/typecheck clean.

## T-2026-04-26-014 — AuthorizationService consumed by Catalog & Streaming (E07-F01-S02)

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: single commit on `feat/authorization-service`. `CommonAccessModule` in `src/common/access/` provides `LruAuthorizationService` behind `AUTHORIZATION_SERVICE` token. `ListLibrariesHandler` + `GetLibraryHandler` filter by grant. 127 tests green.
- Owner: claude

## T-2026-04-26-013 — AccessGrant aggregate + admin endpoints (E07-F01-S01)

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: three commits on `feat/access-grant`: `d82bceb` (spec), `cba2ae2` (codegen), `9315210` (impl). Merged into main as a fast-forward chain.
- Owner: claude
- Goal: admin can grant a user READ access on a library or course, revoke it, and list a user's grants — gated by Better Auth session role check.
- Spec diff: `packages/specs/openapi/openapi.yaml` — three new paths + AccessGrantDto / AccessGrantListDto / RegisterGrantRequest / GrantTarget / GrantLevel. Spec version 0.2.0 → 0.3.0.
- Codegen impact: yes — TS + Dart regenerated end-to-end (Java prerequisite from T-012 in place).
- Design impact: none for v1.
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] OpenAPI: registerGrant / revokeGrant / listGrantsByUser + DTOs with discriminated GrantTarget
  - [x] TS + Dart codegen
  - [x] Prisma `AccessGrant` model + composite unique + migration SQL
  - [x] domain aggregate at `apps/backend/src/modules/access/domain/grant/` (mirror of catalog pattern)
  - [x] Prisma adapter; P2002 → `GrantAlreadyExistsError` (409)
  - [x] CQRS handlers: register, revoke, list-by-user, plus get-by-id for post-write re-read
  - [x] AccessController + AdminGuard + AccessModule registered in app.module.ts
  - [x] 32 new tests covering domain invariants, all four handlers, repo roundtrip, admin-guard. 102/102 passing.

## T-2026-04-26-012 — fix Dart codegen (openapi-generator-cli env conflict)

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: merged locally to main as `a77c9af` (`git merge --ff-only` from `chore/dart-codegen-fix`).
- Owner: claude
- Goal: `pnpm spec:codegen` succeeds end-to-end so the Dart Dio client tracks the OpenAPI spec.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: yes — Dart leg now produces output for new endpoints
- Design impact: none
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] reproduced the failure: actual root cause is "Unable to locate a Java Runtime" (JVM missing on macOS), not a NestJS dep wrapper conflict — the earlier diagnosis was wrong
  - [x] installed OpenJDK 21 LTS via Homebrew (`brew install openjdk@21`) and set `JAVA_HOME`
  - [x] re-ran `pnpm spec:codegen` end-to-end — all four legs (openapi-typescript, hey-api/openapi-ts, openapi-generator-cli dart-dio, asyncapi) succeed
  - [x] committed regenerated Dart artefacts: CatalogApi + LibraryDto / LibraryListDto / RegisterLibraryRequest + ApiDoc markdown + test scaffolds
  - [x] documented the Java prerequisite in `docs/troubleshooting.md` (Homebrew install, JAVA_HOME export, Linux/Windows hints, CI `actions/setup-java@v4`)

## T-2026-04-26-011 — fix workspace tsc regression in generated `@app/api-client-ts`

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: merged locally to main as `03a6030` (`git merge --ff-only` from `chore/api-client-ts-strictness`).
- Owner: claude
- Goal: workspace `tsc --noEmit` exits 0 across the repo after E06 codegen introduced strict-typing mismatches in the generated `@hey-api/openapi-ts` output.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: subtle — consumers now read `.d.ts` from `dist/`, not raw `.ts`
- Design impact: none
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] add `packages/api-client-ts/tsconfig.build.json` (emitDeclarationOnly to `dist/`)
  - [x] flip `package.json`: `types`, `exports.types` → `./dist/index.d.ts`; runtime `main` stays at raw `.ts` (Node `--experimental-strip-types`)
  - [x] root `prepare` and `spec:codegen` chain `pnpm --filter @app/api-client-ts build` so dist always exists after install / codegen
  - [x] verified: `pnpm -r typecheck` clean for all 8 TS projects; lint 0 errors / 53 vue-formatting warnings; backend tests 70/70

## T-2026-04-26-010 — Library aggregate + register/list/get endpoints (E06-F01-S01)

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: three commits on `feat/library-aggregate`: `a710c5d` (spec), `be9ac44` (TS codegen), `0ef1607` (impl). Merged into main as a fast-forward chain.
- Owner: claude
- Goal: first real domain story for Catalog — Library aggregate with name + rootPath invariants, persisted via Prisma behind a domain-owned port, exposed at `POST/GET /api/v1/libraries{,/{id}}`.
- Spec diff: `packages/specs/openapi/openapi.yaml` (3 paths + 3 schemas, version bumped 0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
- Codegen impact: yes — TS regenerated; Dart skipped (env issue tracked separately)
- Design impact: none
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] OpenAPI: registerLibrary / listLibraries / getLibrary + LibraryDto / LibraryListDto / RegisterLibraryRequest
  - [x] TS codegen committed separately
  - [x] Library aggregate at `apps/backend/src/modules/catalog/domain/library/` (path corrected from `contexts/` to match the existing `modules/` pattern + boundaries)
  - [x] LibraryRepository port + Prisma adapter + mapper
  - [x] CQRS: RegisterLibraryCommand + ListLibrariesQuery + GetLibraryQuery handlers
  - [x] CatalogController + CatalogModule registered in app.module.ts
  - [x] Prisma `Library` model + migration SQL (authored manually because Docker was off; identical to what `prisma migrate dev --create-only` would produce)
  - [x] 5 spec files (aggregate, three handlers, repository roundtrip), 70/70 passing
  - [x] backend `lint` clean; workspace `tsc` regression in generated TS clients tracked as T-011 (not E06 fault)

## T-2026-04-26-009 — Prisma generate postinstall + close E01-F01-S02

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: merged locally to main as `a6006cf` (no GitHub PR; `git merge --ff-only` from `chore/prisma-generate`).
- Owner: claude
- Goal: workspace-wide `pnpm -r lint` finishes with zero errors on a clean clone right after `pnpm install`, without any manual codegen step.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: none
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] run `prisma generate` once to verify lint/typecheck go green
  - [x] wire `postinstall: prisma generate` in `apps/backend/package.json`
  - [x] verify postinstall fires on `pnpm install`
  - [x] confirm `pnpm -r lint` reports 0 errors workspace-wide
  - [x] flip E01-F01-S02 to ✅ Done; TODO progress 7 / 115 → 8 / 115

## T-2026-04-26-008 — stage the design bundle under docs/design/ + index + .gitattributes

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: merged locally to main as `5a57b7f` (no GitHub PR; `git merge --ff-only` from `chore/design-bundle-index`).
- Owner: claude
- Goal: a clone of the repository carries the full design handoff bundle alongside an index that names every project slug, its consumption story, and its file inventory; `.gitattributes` collapses prototype HTML/JSX/CSS as vendored.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: yes — bundle is now first-class repo content
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] move `docs/design/uploads/DESIGN_BRIEF.md` → `docs/design/DESIGN_BRIEF.md`
  - [x] write `docs/design/README.md` (index + handoff conventions)
  - [x] write `.gitattributes` (linguist-vendored on `docs/design/**` + linguist-generated on Dart tokens)
  - [x] flip `docs/roadmap/tasks/E00-F01-S01.md` to ✅ Done; tick TODO; bump progress to 7 / 115
  - [x] move T-006 / T-007 to `done.md`

## T-2026-04-26-007 — apps/backend/src/shared kernel: Branded IDs + DomainError + subclasses

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: merged locally to main as `a3a8449` (no GitHub PR; `git merge --ff-only` from `chore/backend-shared-kernel`).
- Owner: claude
- Goal: cross-context kernel for `apps/backend` — `Brand<T,B>`/`Id<B>` for compile-time identifier safety and `DomainError` (+ `InvariantViolation`/`NotFound`/`PermissionDenied`) for RFC 9457 mapping.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: none
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] write `apps/backend/src/shared/{branded-id,domain-error}.ts` + spec files
  - [x] move three `common/errors/domain-error` import sites to `shared/`
  - [x] remove `apps/backend/src/common/errors/`
  - [x] add `shared` element to `boundaries/elements`
  - [x] tests 43/43; lint/typecheck regress-free (only pre-existing prisma type errors remain)

## T-2026-04-26-006 — eslint-plugin-boundaries: enforce DDD bounded-context boundaries

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: merged locally to main as `6a17c89` (no GitHub PR; `git merge --ff-only` from `chore/eslint-boundaries`).
- Owner: claude
- Goal: a sibling-module import inside `apps/backend/src/modules/<X>` referencing `apps/backend/src/modules/<Y>` (Y ≠ X) fails lint with a readable, action-oriented message.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: none
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] add `eslint-plugin-boundaries` + `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` to `@app/eslint-config`
  - [x] wire `boundaries/elements` (module / common / i18n / app) and `boundaries/element-types` rule in `nest.mjs`
  - [x] mutation test confirmed cross-import rejection with the expected message
  - [x] left `boundaries/element-types` (v5 syntax) — v6 `boundaries/dependencies` rejected the migrated config; deferred follow-up

## T-2026-04-26-005 — archive sweep: mark already-shipped roadmap stories as Done

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: merged locally to main as `c19c247` (no GitHub PR; `git merge --ff-only` from `chore/roadmap-archive-sweep`).
- Owner: claude
- Goal: walk every `docs/roadmap/tasks/E*.md` card, flip status to ✅ Done where the story's acceptance is already satisfied by the current codebase. Conservative — borderline left at ⬜.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: none
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] inventory: 6 Done (E01-F01-S01, E02-F01-S02, E02-F02-S03, E03-F01-S01, E12-F01-S01, E22-F01-S02), 5 deliberate borderline
  - [x] update each Done card: status line, sub-step boxes, Notes block
  - [x] tick matching boxes in `docs/roadmap/TODO.md` and update progress counter (`6 / 115`)
  - [x] sanity check on counts
  - [x] prettier on touched markdown

## T-2026-04-26-004 — design-token cross-source audit (PR 3b)

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: merged locally to main as `5189c92` (no GitHub PR; `git merge --ff-only` from `chore/design-tokens-audit`).
- Owner: claude
- Goal: cross-source audit script comparing `docs/design/shared/tokens.json` (palette) ↔ `specs/design/tokens/*.json` (DTCG); fails CI on hex drift. Plus closing residual scale drift (spacing/radius/font) surfaced by the first run.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: locked the brand alignment behind a script
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] write `packages/design-tokens/scripts/audit-cross-source.ts`
  - [x] add `audit:cross-source` script to `packages/design-tokens/package.json`
  - [x] close residual scale drift in `specs/design/tokens/{spacing,radius,typography}.json`
  - [x] mutation test confirmed audit fails on a flipped hex
  - [x] new `packages/design-tokens/README.md` documents both sources, alias layer, and audit's role
  - [x] lint, typecheck, audit (42 / 42) all green; 4 known prototype-internal drifts reported as ℹ

## T-2026-04-26-003 — brand-align design tokens + emit alias layer (PR 3a)

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: merged locally to main as `9e0a851` (no GitHub PR; merge happened on the local clone via `git merge --ff-only` from `chore/design-tokens-canonical`).
- Owner: claude
- Goal: replace the blue-stub palette in `specs/design/tokens/*.json` with CourseShelf brand values and teach the emitter to publish prototype short CSS-var names (`--bg`, `--surface`, `--primary`, …) as `var()` aliases of the DTCG long names.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: yes — first time the code-stack carries actual CourseShelf brand
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] rewrite `specs/design/tokens/color.json` with brand hex values + new roles (text.loud, surface.skeleton{Base,Shine}, brand.accentSoft, status.{\*}Soft)
  - [x] rewrite `specs/design/tokens/shadow.json` with brand shadow tints
  - [x] tune `specs/design/tokens/motion.json` durations/easings to match prototype curves
  - [x] extend `emit-scss.ts` with themed alias section + static `--d-*`/`--e-*` aliases
  - [x] verified: short-name alias hex byte-equals prototype hex for all 22 color/shadow pairs (dark + light)
  - [x] lint --fix + typecheck clean

## T-2026-04-26-002 — rewrite roadmap story registry under the current stack

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: merged locally to main as `417bcfe` (no GitHub PR; merge happened on the local clone via `git merge --ff-only` from `chore/roadmap-collapse`).
- Owner: claude
- Goal: every story in `docs/roadmap/tools/generate.py` reflects the real codebase — `apps/backend`, generated `@app/api-client-{ts,dart}`, Nuxt UI v4 + Tailwind 4 + `@app/ui`, Centrifugo realtime, and the current `packages/design-tokens` pipeline.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: none
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] inventory legacy terms in the registry
  - [x] swap paths: `apps/api`→`apps/backend`; legacy contract packages → `packages/specs` + `@app/api-client-{ts,dart}`; `packages/shared-kernel`→`apps/backend/src/shared`
  - [x] swap web stack: Vuetify→Nuxt UI v4 + Tailwind 4 + `@app/ui`; remove `useApi/useAuth/useAuthToken` composables in favour of `@app/api-client-ts`
  - [x] swap design pipeline: Style Dictionary → current `packages/design-tokens` (`pnpm design:build`)
  - [x] swap commands: `pnpm gen:all` → `pnpm spec:codegen`
  - [x] add Centrifugo coverage: AsyncAPI sub-step in E02 + new epic E24
  - [x] dissolve E05 into E04-F01-S01
  - [x] keep Drift in E15 as-is
  - [x] run generator; 115 task files, zero warnings
  - [x] prettier on regenerated `.md`; sanity-grep clean

## T-2026-04-26-001 — collapse duplicate roadmap copies, retarget generator path

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: merged locally to main as `32dcead` (no GitHub PR; merge happened on the local clone via `git merge --ff-only` from `chore/roadmap-collapse`).
- Owner: claude
- Goal: one source of truth for the roadmap lives under `docs/roadmap/`; the generator writes there instead of a sandbox path.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: none
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] move `docs/tasks/` → `docs/roadmap/tasks/`
  - [x] remove `docs/{README,ROADMAP,TODO}.md` (untracked duplicates)
  - [x] write `docs/roadmap/README.md` (workflow points at `specs/tasks/active.md`; `packages/api-contracts` → `packages/specs/openapi/openapi.yaml`; `pnpm gen:all` → `pnpm spec:codegen`)
  - [x] retarget `docs/roadmap/tools/generate.py`: `OUT` derived from `__file__`; `write_readme()`/`write_roadmap()` mention the script at its real path
  - [x] prettier on touched `.md`
