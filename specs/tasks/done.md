## T-2026-04-26-002 — rewrite roadmap story registry under the current stack

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: merged locally to main as `417bcfe` (no GitHub PR; merge happened on the local clone via `git merge --ff-only` from `chore/roadmap-collapse`).
- Owner: claude
- Goal: every story in `docs/roadmap/tools/generate.py` reflects the real codebase — `apps/backend`, generated `@app/api-client-{ts,dart}`, Nuxt UI v4 + Tailwind 4 + `@app/ui`, Centrifugo realtime, and the current `packages/design-tokens` pipeline.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: none
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] inventory legacy terms in the registry
  - [x] swap paths: `apps/api`→`apps/backend`; legacy contract packages → `packages/specs` + `@app/api-client-{ts,dart}`; `packages/shared-kernel`→`apps/backend/src/shared`
  - [x] swap web stack: Vuetify→Nuxt UI v4 + Tailwind 4 + `@app/ui`; remove `useApi/useAuth/useAuthToken` composables in favour of `@app/api-client-ts`
  - [x] swap design pipeline: Style Dictionary → current `packages/design-tokens` (`pnpm design:build`)
  - [x] swap commands: `pnpm gen:all` → `pnpm spec:codegen`
  - [x] add Centrifugo coverage: AsyncAPI sub-step in E02 + new epic E24
  - [x] dissolve E05 into E04-F01-S01
  - [x] keep Drift in E15 as-is
  - [x] run generator; 115 task files, zero warnings
  - [x] prettier on regenerated `.md`; sanity-grep clean

## T-2026-04-26-001 — collapse duplicate roadmap copies, retarget generator path

- Created: 2026-04-26
- Completed: 2026-04-26
- Result: merged locally to main as `32dcead` (no GitHub PR; merge happened on the local clone via `git merge --ff-only` from `chore/roadmap-collapse`).
- Owner: claude
- Goal: one source of truth for the roadmap lives under `docs/roadmap/`; the generator writes there instead of a sandbox path.
- Spec diff: none
- Codegen impact: no
- Design impact: none
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] move `docs/tasks/` → `docs/roadmap/tasks/`
  - [x] remove `docs/{README,ROADMAP,TODO}.md` (untracked duplicates)
  - [x] write `docs/roadmap/README.md` (workflow points at `specs/tasks/active.md`; `packages/api-contracts` → `packages/specs/openapi/openapi.yaml`; `pnpm gen:all` → `pnpm spec:codegen`)
  - [x] retarget `docs/roadmap/tools/generate.py`: `OUT` derived from `__file__`; `write_readme()`/`write_roadmap()` mention the script at its real path
  - [x] prettier on touched `.md`
