## T-2026-09-14-stepik-scraper — a Stepik course fills itself from the open catalog API

- Created: 2026-09-14
- Owner: claude
- Spec: none — measured live against `stepik.org/api/courses/181875`; nothing
  about the wire contract changes
- Goal: a `stepik.org/course/{id}` URL fills the metadata editor from Stepik's
  own keyless API instead of recovering one field through the json-ld
  fallback.
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] `StepikScraper` + recorded fixtures
  - [x] registry wiring (unconditional — no key, like Coursera)
  - [x] tests
  - [x] card `E30-F02-S02`, `TODO.md` row, `docs/user-guide.md`
- Status: in-progress

## T-2026-09-14-fix-centrifugo-namespaces — declare the namespaces the contract uses

- Created: 2026-09-14
- Owner: claude
- Spec: none — the AsyncAPI contract was already correct; found while
  debugging a live NAS deployment whose scan progress never moved
- Goal: every Centrifugo namespace used by a channel in
  `packages/specs/asyncapi/centrifugo.yaml` must be declared in every
  Centrifugo configuration, and stay that way.
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] add `scans` and `maintenance` to dev, prod and release configs
  - [x] `scripts/check-realtime-namespaces.ts` deriving the required set from
        the contract
  - [x] wire it as `pnpm check:realtime` and a CI step
- Status: in-progress
