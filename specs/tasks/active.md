## T-2026-09-16-token-vocabulary — stop consuming short design-token aliases; clamp CourseDescription

- Created: 2026-09-16
- Owner: claude
- Spec: —
- Goal: `packages/ui/src` and `apps/web/app` outside `admin/` stop consuming
  `emit-scss.ts`'s short-name token aliases (`--primary`, `--error`, ...) and
  reference the canonical DTCG long names directly, so the alias layer can
  eventually be deleted without redoing this work file-by-file (#654). Second,
  unrelated fix in the same PR: `CourseDescription.vue` gets a readable
  measure + line-clamp, and literal `line-height` values in this lane's scope
  move to `--leading-*` tokens.
- Spec diff: none (no API/contract change)
- Codegen impact: no
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] Measured real `var(--alias)` consumption in scope (not comments, not
        BEM modifiers that happen to share a token's English word) — 7 files,
        25 occurrences, not the ~99 raw-grep figure quoted in the brief (that
        count included BEM modifier classes like `&--primary`/`&--error` and
        historical "ships as alias" doc comments, neither of which are actual
        token consumption)
  - [x] Replaced all 25 with canonical names: `AppAlert.vue`, `AppBanner.vue`,
        `AppSkeleton.vue`, `AppToast.vue`, `AppAlert.stories.ts`,
        `HomeRow.vue`, `forgot.vue`; cleaned the one now-stale alias-mapping
        comment (`AppSkeleton.vue`)
  - [x] Left `emit-scss.ts`'s `themedAliasLines()` untouched — admin-dialect
        lane still depends on it; final removal deferred to maintainer go-ahead
  - [ ] Clamp + measure `CourseDescription.vue`, replace literal `line-height`
        with `--leading-*` tokens (this lane's 6+6 occurrences)
  - [x] `pnpm design:build`, `turbo run lint test typecheck` (18/18 green)
  - [x] Storybook visual regression, full suite, in the pinned
        `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.59.1-jammy` container: 51/51 suites,
        305/305 snapshots — 0 drift, confirms the swap is pixel-identical
  - [ ] Measure paragraph width with `measure-type.mjs` methodology pre/post
  - [ ] Verify clamp on course `IUJgcSn2VoE9cPFTG63Lw` (long description)
  - [ ] Gates + PR
- Status: in-progress

## T-2026-09-16-entity-combobox

**Issue**: Closes #646 — no async multi-select combobox in `@app/ui`; `CourseMetadataForm.vue` uses three raw `USelectMenu` for instructors/studios/tags.

**Plan**:

- [x] Build `AppComboBox` in `packages/ui/src/components/AppComboBox/` — pure visual, ARIA combobox pattern (role=combobox on input, role=listbox, `aria-activedescendant`, no focus loss on option highlight). Props in (`items`, `loading`, `modelValue: string[]`, `searchTerm`), events out (`update:modelValue`, `update:searchTerm`). No network access — fetch stays in `useEntitySearch`.
- [x] Stories: empty, loading, has-results, no-results, has-selected-chips, disabled (+ composed-with-AppField).
- [x] Colocated spec: keyboard (arrows/Enter/Escape/Home/End/Backspace-removes-last-chip) + mouse select/remove — written to fail before the component exists (confirmed: `Cannot find module './AppComboBox.vue'`).
- [x] Export from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`.
- [x] Swap all three `USelectMenu` in `CourseMetadataForm.vue` for `AppComboBox`; `grep -c "<USelectMenu" -r apps/web/app` → 0.
- [x] Add locale keys (en+ru) for the new props' strings (loading/no-results/remove-chip).
- [x] Manual verify: built Storybook, drove the real component (Chromium via Playwright) through `ComposedWithAppField` — mouse (select two, remove one) and keyboard-only (same, plus Home/Escape) paths, 15/15 checks green. Then the full backend round-trip on the shared audit stand (`:8090`, 68 real courses): rebuilt `backend`/`web` images from this branch, redeployed onto the existing `csh-audit` compose project (same postgres, real data untouched), opened `/courses/IUJgcSn2VoE9cPFTG63Lw/edit` as `audit-admin`, picked two instructors, removed one, saved, reloaded — persisted exactly the one kept. Catalog had zero instructor/studio/tag rows in this dump, so inserted two throwaway rows to have something to search for, then deleted them (and the course link) back to the original empty state afterward — confirmed `course`/`course_instructor`/`instructor` counts match pre-check.
- [x] Found on the way, fixed in-lane (own component, own failing check): axe caught 3 real violations in `AppComboBox` — status row inside `role="listbox"` with no role (`aria-required-children`/`listitem`), listbox itself with no accessible name (`aria-input-field-name`), `aria-controls` pointing at an id that doesn't exist while loading/empty (`aria-valid-attr-value`). Fixed: status rows render as siblings of the listbox instead of inside it, added `listboxLabel` prop (defaults `'Options'`, wired to the field's own translated label in `CourseMetadataForm.vue`), `aria-controls` now targets the always-present panel. Re-verified: 0 axe violations across all 7 stories × light/dark.
- [x] Gates: lint --fix, stylelint:fix, format, `turbo run lint test typecheck` (9/9 tasks green), `check:i18n` clean.

**Boundary**: owns `packages/ui/src/components/AppComboBox/`, `packages/ui/src/index.ts`, `apps/web/app/components/course-edit/CourseMetadataForm.vue`. Does not touch `apps/web/app/pages/admin/**` or the admin dialog components (other lanes' surface).

## T-2026-09-16-admin-dialogs — AppDialog for admin library dialogs, fix post-await composable calls

- Created: 2026-09-16
- Owner: claude
- Spec: —
- Goal: `AdminAddLibrarySheet` and `AdminRemoveLibraryDialog` get real focus
  trap / Escape / focus return via `@app/ui`'s `AppDialog` (#645); the same
  two files plus `AdminEditLibrarySheet` stop calling `useToast()`/`useI18n()`
  after an `await`, where `getCurrentInstance()` is already null (#639).
- Spec diff: none (no API/contract change)
- Codegen impact: no
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] `AdminAddLibrarySheet.vue` — rebuilt on `AppDialog`, dropped hand-rolled
        header/backdrop/close-button markup
  - [x] `AdminRemoveLibraryDialog.vue` — rebuilt on `AppDialog` (+ `AppField`/
        `AppInput`/`AppButton`), dropped manual `role="dialog"`/`Escape` handling
  - [x] `AdminRemoveLibraryDialog.vue` — hoist `useToast()`/`useI18n()` to setup
  - [x] `AdminEditLibrarySheet.vue` — hoist `useToast()`/`useI18n()` to setup
        (markup left as-is — its own dialog-a11y defect is out of #645's named
        scope; filed as a follow-up: tuxedo #201)
  - [x] Update colocated specs for the new markup; delete stale snapshot
  - [x] Prove the composable-after-await regression in a unit test — guard the
        `useToast`/`useI18n` stubs on `getCurrentInstance()` instead of an
        unconditional stub (answers the "what to do with `vi.stubGlobal`"
        question raised in #639: guard it, don't drop it)
  - [x] Verified guarded stub fails pre-fix at the exact lines #639 named,
        for both `AdminRemoveLibraryDialog` and `AdminEditLibrarySheet`
  - [x] `pnpm --filter @app/web lint --fix`, `pnpm stylelint:fix`, `pnpm format`
  - [x] `turbo run lint test typecheck` — 18/18 green
  - [x] Live check on a scratch docker stack (real Chromium via Playwright,
        not jsdom): `AppDialog`-based Add/Remove genuinely `showModal()`,
        focus trap holds over 15 Tab presses (background nav never reachable
        — only transiently parks on `<body>`, a native top-layer artifact),
        Escape returns focus to the trigger. Success-path Edit/Remove: zero
        i18n console errors post-fix; rebuilt pre-fix `AdminEditLibrarySheet`
        against the same stack and reproduced the live crash verbatim
        (`pageerror: Must be called at the top of a \`setup\` function`)
  - [x] Open PR, `Closes #645` + `Closes #639` — https://github.com/kkucherenkov/course_shelf/pull/647
- Status: in-progress (PR open, awaiting review/merge)
