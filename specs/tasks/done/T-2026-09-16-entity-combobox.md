**Issue**: Closes #646 — no async multi-select combobox in `@app/ui`; `CourseMetadataForm.vue` uses three raw `USelectMenu` for instructors/studios/tags.

**Plan**:

- [x] Build `AppComboBox` in `packages/ui/src/components/AppComboBox/` — pure visual, ARIA combobox pattern (role=combobox on input, role=listbox, `aria-activedescendant`, no focus loss on option highlight). Props in (`items`, `loading`, `modelValue: string[]`, `searchTerm`), events out (`update:modelValue`, `update:searchTerm`). No network access — fetch stays in `useEntitySearch`.
- [x] Stories: empty, loading, has-results, no-results, has-selected-chips, disabled (+ composed-with-AppField).
- [x] Colocated spec: keyboard (arrows/Enter/Escape/Home/End/Backspace-removes-last-chip) + mouse select/remove — written to fail before the component exists (confirmed: `Cannot find module './AppComboBox.vue'`).
- [x] Export from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`.
- [x] Swap all three `USelectMenu` in `CourseMetadataForm.vue` for `AppComboBox`; `grep -c "<USelectMenu" -r apps/web/app` → 0.
- [x] Add locale keys (en+ru) for the new props' strings (loading/no-results/remove-chip).
- [x] Manual verify: built Storybook, drove the real component (Chromium via Playwright) through `ComposedWithAppField` — mouse (select two, remove one) and keyboard-only (same, plus Home/Escape) paths, 15/15 checks green. Then the full backend round-trip on the shared audit stand (`:8090`, 68 real courses): rebuilt `backend`/`web` images from this branch, redeployed onto the existing `csh-audit` compose project (same postgres, real data untouched), opened `/courses/IUJgcSn2VoE9cPFTG63Lw/edit` as `audit-admin`, picked two instructors, removed one, saved, reloaded — persisted exactly the one kept. Catalog had zero instructor/studio/tag rows in this dump, so inserted two throwaway rows to have something to search for, then deleted them (and the course link) back to the original empty state afterward — confirmed `course`/`course_instructor`/`instructor` counts match pre-check.
- [x] Found on the way, fixed in-lane (own component, own failing check): axe caught 3 real violations in `AppComboBox` — status row inside `role="listbox"` with no role (`aria-required-children`/`listitem`), listbox itself with no accessible name (`aria-input-field-name`), `aria-controls` pointing at an id that doesn't exist while loading/empty (`aria-valid-attr-value`). Fixed: status rows render as siblings of the listbox instead of inside it, added `listboxLabel` prop (defaults `'Options'`, wired to the field's own translated label in `CourseMetadataForm.vue`), `aria-controls` now targets the always-present panel. Re-verified: 0 axe violations across all 7 stories × light/dark.
- [x] Gates: lint --fix, stylelint:fix, format, `turbo run lint test typecheck` (9/9 tasks green), `check:i18n` clean.

**Boundary**: owns `packages/ui/src/components/AppComboBox/`, `packages/ui/src/index.ts`, `apps/web/app/components/course-edit/CourseMetadataForm.vue`. Does not touch `apps/web/app/pages/admin/**` or the admin dialog components (other lanes' surface).
