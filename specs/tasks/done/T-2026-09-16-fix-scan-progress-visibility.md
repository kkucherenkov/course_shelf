## T-2026-09-16-fix-scan-progress-visibility — honest scan progress, one clock, wired buttons

- Created: 2026-09-16
- Owner: claude
- Goal: scan progress card stops lying about state (heuristic 1 — visibility
  of system status). `#593`: percent is hardcoded 0 (no `totalFiles` on
  `ScanDto`, and that's correct — replace with an indeterminate bar + the
  already-existing "files scanned" counter, not a fake percent); the two
  renders of the same running scan (page vs notifier) disagree on
  added/updated/errors; Cancel button has no backing endpoint (`cancelled`
  is v2-reserved per openapi.yaml) — remove it; "N errors" button is
  unwired — wire it to the real `ScanError[]` already on `ScanDto`. `#603`:
  two independent elapsed-time clocks (2s-poll-bound computed vs a separate
  1s timer) drift apart for the same scan — consolidate into one shared
  clock.
- Sub-steps:
  - [x] #593 — remove fake `percent`; indeterminate bar while running, full
        bar on terminal states; fix admin page's hardcoded
        added=0/updated=0/errors=0 to real `liveScan` values; drop dead
        Cancel button + prop/emit from `AppScanProgress`; wire
        `errors-clicked` (admin page: inline error list from
        `liveScan.errors`; notifier: navigate to the library's admin page)
  - [x] #603 — `useElapsedTime` composable: one shared 1s clock used by both
        `useScanProgress` and `ScanLifecycleNotifier`
  - [x] gates: lint, stylelint, format, `turbo run lint test typecheck`
        (@app/web 475/475, @app/ui 918/918, both clean)
